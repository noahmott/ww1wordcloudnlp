              "{'na_uk_01': 'Dear Mr Welsh,\\n\\nWe were only out here a matter of a few hours before we went into the trenches; we were there for eight days and then came on to what is called a Rest Camp. I suppose it is called that to distinguish it from the trenches because the men are at work all day road and trench making and it comes under both rifle and artillery fire. We got here at 7 o’clock yesterday morning and were shelled at 9 o’clock.\\n\\nIn the trenches it was fairly bad, they are so narrow and smelly and one is being potted at and shelled all the time. A turn of eight days was really quite long enough because it is strenuous work and even when you do turn in for a rest you have to be ready to turn out at once on an alarm.\\n\\nThe country is really quite pretty and just like the hills and valleys of South Wales, but there are no brooks or rivers. It rains hard for a month each year usually about this time and then there is no more until the next rainy season. But although it is so gloriously sunny something is wrong with the place and it really isn’t as healthy as it looks. I think the flies have something to do with it as well as the heat and the still unburied dead bodies about. There are millions and millions of flies here and they are all over everything. Put a cup of tea down without a cover and it is immediately covered with dead ones, they are all round your mouth and directly you open it to speak or to eat in they pop. It is a game. We have all got nets of course, we should have been worried, no medicine by now if we hadn’t.\\n\\nWe get plenty of bully beef and army biscuits, but bread and fresh meat is still a luxury and it is not possible to buy anything. It must have been a “No Man’s Land” because there are no houses or buildings of any kind to be seen and except the flies, the only living things are green canaries and lizards.\\n\\nWe live in dugouts built up the reverse sides of the hills. They are just holes really, but all the same they can be made very comfortable with a bit of digging and a few waterproof sheets. They are not shell proof by any means and the one I slept in during my first night here was knocked in completely by a shell pitching right into it. Fortunately I was not at home at the time. We have another now and I must try and get a photo of it and let you see what it is like. I must send you one of our\\n\\nMess dugout too.\\n\\nEverything here is named after the Regiment responsible for the making or taking. For instance the road we made from our trenches to this camp is called “New Bedford Rd” and the ridge we took and now occupy is called on the army maps, Bedford Ridge. I have just been filling in and colouring my map and find it is one of the most, if not the most, advanced line of the lot. Standing on that ridge it is possible to see what a lot of country we have taken and now hold, but there is nothing to get wildly excited about. Each position is strengthened as much as possible before another attempt is made to push on and the whole thing is just steady progress. Something might happen suddenly, I only hope it does.\\n\\nWe have had some very big ships out here and they have been bombarding the forts heavily now for some few days, and there are cruisers, monitors etc. standing in the bay helping the land batteries to shell the trenches. You see a flash and then wait a long time before hearing the boom and the shriek of the shell passing over our heads, almost together, then look round quickly and see the burst of the shell in or over the trenches sometimes before hearing the explosion. The first we know of shells aimed at us is the bang of the explosion, and it is too late to get out of the way. Three officers were laid flat on their backs the other day without any hurt except to their dignity and farther on six men were buried without one being injured. It isn’t always like that though.\\n\\nThere is quite good bathing here when we can find time to go. As the beach is in full view of the enemy, and comes under their shell fire, it would not appeal to the nervous. We never keep closer together than ten yards when we are undressing and swimming in hopes that the Turk will not consider one man worth the price of a shell. We have had some casualties through the men keeping too close together, but after washing out of a teacup for a week or more it is worth a bit of risk to get rid of some of the trench dust and smell and feel and look clean again. And really is the best bathing I’ve ever had. The water is quite warm and clear.\\n\\nAll the hospital work is done on board a ship that stands in the bay. If the cases are serious or lengthy they are transferred to one of the hospital ships that calls daily and then go to either one of the bases or back to England. We land troops night or day in spite of the fact that they come under fire so it is possible for a man to be on his way back wounded, by the same ship that bought him from the base, without ever having landed.\\n\\nWe had a grand voyage out. All the officers had either staterooms or 1st Class cabins and the food mostly was just the same as we should have had on an ordinary cruise to India or Australia, wherever it is that the Cruise Line calls. The usual cabin stewards and waiters were in attendance and it was difficult to remember that we were not exactly on a pleasure trip. We did enjoy those two weeks…\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nH.W. Cronin, Lieutenant.\\n\\nI am acting as captain until some of the others come back from hospital.',\n",
              " 'na_uk_02': 'Dear Nic (Boyce),\\n\\nThanks very much for your interesting letter… I wondered when I would hear from someone at the office. Also many thanks for your good wishes and congratulations on my marriage which I have conveyed to my wife. I am sure she will thank you all very much.\\n\\nWell to tell you a little about our experiences, we started off mysteriously one Sunday from Devonport on the captured German liner Derflinger, not a bad boat. The Warrant Officers had 2nd class quarters it was all right. Food was very fair. Submarine pickets* every night for one of the four companies, lights out… at seven or half past. Stole by Gibraltar at night in a fog expecting it to be torpedoed. We did reach Malta in due course after skirting north African coast, spent a day there, went ashore, had a few drinks which we needed being very hot and then on to Alexandria for three days, ashore every night, not a bad place, of course the lower men didn’t go, except for a route march on the Saturday. Our movements were kept very secret and we couldn’t find out what was to be done with our division, we then pushed to Port Said and had a day there. All of a sudden, we received orders to sail and soon found we were off to Gallipoli as we were passing through the Aegean sea, which is as you know full of pretty islands. Some hours before reaching Lemnos, the naval guns could be heard booming and we ran into the magnificent harbour there full of shipping and life. After a day there, we pushed on to Imbros 4½ miles from Sulva Bay during the afternoon they treated us to a naval shelling of Achi Baba, which is really the other side of the peninsula, but they shoot over the hills and mountains here. It was a fine sight and many of our chaps went sick at once. At night (Sunday 9/8/15) our good ship made for Anafarta Bay where a new landing had been effected two days before. 900 rounds, four days’ rations each, as much as a man is expected to carry and they dumped us over the side in lighters [a type of flat-bottomed barge] at 7am, a short journey through the boom defences and we were ashore waiting for something to turn up.\\n\\nBivouacked on the beach and were put on unloading lighters till about 10 when the Turks spotted us and started shelling, two men killed and four wounded to start with and we lost a few more, wounded during the day although naturally we took what cover we could. I had one or two near me whilst getting a timber out of the hold of a lighter but managed to dodge them all right. At night my company received orders to take picks and shovels up into the firing line which was about five miles away half way up Chocolate Hill… Well Nic the 10th were soon in the thick of it as we advanced across the salt lake in extended order.\\n\\nRifle fire now we had to dodge and many of our chaps got hit rather seriously I have since found out. I was glad of a rest at the foot of the hill but had to push on again and deliver the goods, after feeling about in the dark for some time our guide led us in single file up behind the firing line, where we laid down, bullets were whistling round but we managed to escape them… The enemy were yelling for all they were worth and I was glad when our captain ordered us down again to the beach. This took us some hours and when we reached the place, the other three had gone up to reinforce the firing line, so up we went again the next day about 6pm, nearly all things are done here in the dark as we are in view all the time. We again advanced across the take from Lala Baba, my heels were nearly raw through new boots and I eventually had to rest for a fortnight later on. Well on our right was a hill burning furiously with many a chap caught in the flames and so perishing (not our regiment).\\n\\nWe finished on rather a feathered bed and did not find the other Company ‘til next day, it was a night, we were all parched with the heat, and no water. Dried up and had to dig ourselves in, it’s no light job this hiding being… like an ostrich, ‘til you make a hole large enough to get into and make yourself head cover.',\n",
              " 'na_uk_03': 'Dear Lack,\\n\\nMany thanks for the photographs received. We all think they are good and on Saturday the six of us had out photo taken here in a similar position– in khaki. The two pictures together should make a lasting memento.\\n\\nWe have had little spare time since we have been training here. Having been through company drill mixed with route marches, physical drill, semaphore, knot tying and frog, long jumping etc. Some of our men were able to go to town on Saturday… but I myself with a few others have been under orders for overseas service now waiting to proceed, so popping up town seems out of the question for us. We are numbered in alphabetical order, and in the order we are sent out. We are now fully equipped. I enclose … postage for the photographs. If you are printing any more you might save me one as I am afraid I have spoilt mine, it got bent in my overcoat pocket on Saturday. Please remember me to all at the office…\\n\\nN. Boyce',\n",
              " 'na_uk_04': 'Dear Bert,\\n\\nJust a few lines to let you know I am alright, hoping you are the same… At the present time we are in dugouts. The weather is simply awful, raining day after day and especially night after night…To tell you the truth, while writing this letter I am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change. We have got our winter fur coats and gum boots, but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine, for instance last night I was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon, which is number 37. It was pitch dark, no light allowed and in a strange place, well honestly I fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents. On a round of inspection this morning to see if all were ‘comfortable’ I was ‘blinded’ up hill and down dale, ‘Sergeant this’ and ‘Sergeant that’.\\n\\nHow can you expect men to live in this, and then to put a dampener on the lot, was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night. They took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so, but they could not find me, for the only thing that would shift me, after settling down, if I may call it that, would be a ‘Jack Johnson’ and then I would have no option.\\n\\nWhile in the trenches last week John and I were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full. The line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling, but one gets used to it. That, to give you an idea, is like sitting at Paddington and hearing the engines screech.\\n\\nAfter our stretch this time I shall be looking forward for a short leave for I have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance. Well I must now conclude…Yours sincerely\\n\\nJack Symons\\n\\nP.S. Every other home down near the rest camp is an Estaminet (small French café) where they sell what they call ‘beer’, and as much as I like a drop of good beer I have given the stuff out here ‘best’ for is awful muc.',\n",
              " 'na_uk_05': 'Dear Mr Hunt,\\n\\nPlease accept yourself and convey to the other gentlemen my best thanks for the State Express cigarettes. They are fine. Oh what a picnic it is in the trenches just now. We have been in the trenches 10 days up to now, and except for the last two days it has been raining almost steadily. The result is mud, mud and yet more mud, knee deep in places. But luckily we have long top boots from trench wear, so that the mud does not worry as much, except that is making our feet as cold as ice… We have been issued with fur jackets so we can keep our bodies warm.\\n\\nJust now the whole countryside is covered with snow and moving objects are distinguishable a long distance off. For instance this morning when I was on duty with the gun I could see the Germans walking down a road away behind their lines. I had several bursts at them with the gun but they were out of range. Made me damned mad I can tell you seeing the blighters and then not being able to lay them out.\\n\\nYou can’t realise the power one seems to possess when handling a Maxim. Personally I feel as if I could lay out the whole German army. We fire about a couple of thousand rounds every night into Fritz’s trenches just to keep them quiet. They (the Germans) have been trying to find the gun, both with their Maxims and with shells, but up to now, they’ve not succeed. Kind regards to everybody. Yours very sincerely,\\n\\nGilbert Williams.',\n",
              " 'na_uk_06': 'I might say we are all merry and bright and not down hearted yet.\\n\\nDear Mr Hunt,\\n\\nReceived card alright for which I must thank you very much. We are still at Longmoor and no signs of moving as I have been made cook’s mate and had to work very hard all through Xmas.\\n\\nSapper Hodges',\n",
              " 'na_uk_07': 'As long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe, so as it went on, this was where I had my first escape. I was on sentry duty for a couple of hours, from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out. I did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly Germans, however it had to be done, it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front, then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against. I fired about five shots at their flashes (the only target to aim at) then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death. I thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that. Our casualties here amounted on the average, to about two per day killed, of course, we thought it terrible at the time at least I did.\\n\\nEarly April saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a well-earned rest, which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast. The remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills. After dinner we put the “cap on” our rest (why so called I do not know) by having a route march for two hours. We spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to Ypres, here we went in to support the Canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days, during which time we lost several hundred men, nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded, we had to retire, the best part being that the Germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood. We stayed here for about a week; then we got to work again, digging reserve trenches just behind the front line, building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemy’s high explosive shells and such like, working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime. One morning we were awakened by the most awful din, it seemed as though hell had broken loose, shells were falling like summer rain. And people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and I admit I took it with a grain of salt, could not be possible I thought, but such I was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 3.30am. This bombardment started and about half an hour later, I, with three others, were ordered to start reinforcing. We went up in fours, it being considered safer that way, half a mile over open ground we had to do, this being swept continually with shells, to give you a slight idea I can say the previous night, just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field, and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all, simply one mass of craters, varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces.\\n\\nI had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where I was, the force of the concussion [explosion] pitched me several yards to my left and I came down rather heavily, however I reached the first line without any further mishap, where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench. Our honours were one V.C. (Victoria Cross), two D.S.O.  (Distinguished Service Orders), one Military Cross and one or two D.C.M. (Distinguished Conduct Medals).\\n\\nThe next day I paraded sick, my back paining me so much that I could not stand straight for a week after. I am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications. We are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the Audit office. Have you any news of Chichester?\\n\\nYours truly,\\n\\n(Rifleman) E.H.C. Stewart',\n",
              " 'na_uk_08': 'This trench of ours is a model in its own way, being fairly safe, and connected by good communication trenches. The Commanding Officer’s house of white sandbags is fitted with window, curtains, and window box with pansies in it. It is furnished with table and chairs also a large mirror. Of course this is quite a ‘one occasion’ affair and don’t imagine we are here town planning with model dwellings etc! But it will show you how soldiers can adapt themselves to circumstances. At the back of our trench is ripening corn and plenty of wildflowers in bloom.\\n\\nWe have also canaries in cages in the trench! But these are used by the miners for testing the air in the mines after the explosion, to see if it was possible to finish off their job. [Censored line] captured from the Germans a short time ago and during the stay we were kept busy with sandbags etc. and at night of course had to especially watch the enemy.\\n\\nWhen in the reserve or support trenches fatigue work has to be done every night, such as carrying food, ammunition, material for the engineers etc. to the firing line, so you can guess it is nothing but continual ‘bob’ work (odd jobs).',\n",
              " 'na_uk_09': 'Dear Mr Hunt\\n\\nMany thanks for your welcome letter volunteering so much interesting news of friends at the office. I wrote to Standew just before receiving your letter, but no doubt a few more lines will be acceptable.\\n\\nBeaumont seems to be doing the best of us all. I saw Williams and Hull about three weeks ago in a small town near here. Of course the Seaforths and Argylls (regiments) always move about together, but we don’t meet very often. I am glad to hear the old section is still in being, and not like the German Empire is fast becoming a thing of the past! And hope your three survivors will be allowed to keep the flag flying until the wanderers return.\\n\\nI have been in the firing line several times, and at four different places, besides being in the support trenches at others. I hear this is called a mobile division which accounts for our gipsy life in France.\\n\\nOur last turn in the firing line, for six days and six in the reserve was the most exciting of all.\\n\\nIt has been a quiet place for two months, until two days after our occupation, when the British exploded mines under some workings of the Germans near their trenches, to prevent them blowing our trench up. Well! That woke them up and the following Saturday they retaliated by opening rapid fire early in the morning.\\n\\nHowever we were ready for them and quickly replied, so they then bombarded us, which to say the least of it was a noisy business. That eventually ceased and rapid firing was quickly in process again, followed by another shelling, which our guns again put a stop to. The whole affair lasted an hour and ten minutes, and although we believe an attack was intended, the Germans didn’t leave their trench, opposite to us. After putting our trench in order again which took some time, as the parapet was blown down for about three yards near me, and a shell burst amongst a lot of beef tins, scattering them and the contents in all directions, besides the bottom of the trench being littered with hundreds of empty cartridges, we proceeded with boiling water for tea, also to show the Huns by the smoke that we were still there. Only a hundred yards separated the two trenches, so it was always a case of “bob down” and the enemy were good shots, as we found out to our cost when they smashed the top glasses in two periscopes within half an hour one morning.\\n\\nAt present the division is resting, and I and two friends have erected a wee bivouac under an apple tree on a farm. It is quite cosy, in fine weather, but last night it was raining hard for several hours, so we had to beat a hasty retreat to an old barn. There is plenty of fruit about here, but the water supply is very bad.\\n\\nLast Sunday morning we enjoyed our first hot bath since our arrival here. An old disused brewery has been turned into baths for troops, also under clothing is washed and disinfected, and kilts ironed there. Fifty tubs are provided for washing in and two large vats filled with cold water to plunge into afterwards.\\n\\nI have not got any stripes yet, but have been studying signalling lately, so expect soon to be in the signal section.\\n\\nI must close now to get this letter away, hoping Mr Taylor, Mr Woodhams, and yourself are keeping well, and with kind regards to you all.\\n\\nYours very sincerely,\\n\\n‘Frosty’',\n",
              " 'na_uk_10': 'Dear Gerald\\n\\nMany thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me. No the news was quite fresh as I do not hear from anybody in the office.\\n\\nWe have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time. We were three days in the Reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment.\\n\\nI am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and I can assure you it was an experience I shall never forget. Anyhow Williams, Kemball and myself came out quite safely.\\n\\nI have seen Frost out here, of course his battalion (8th Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) are in the same brigade also, as a matter of fact, they were in the firing line the night we came out. I received a letter while I was in the trenches from Mr Slater. Yes, I heard about Chamberlain, jolly sad was it not, if you do hear from Dick James you might pass any news on to me…\\n\\nShall be glad to hear from you. I could write more, only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches.\\n\\nI am yours sincerely, Fred Hull.\\n\\nP.S. Of course you know my address. Remember me to all I know.',\n",
              " 'na_uk_11': 'Dear Burgie,\\n\\nWas very glad indeed to get your letters although, your news in regard to Joe comes as a shock. It was the first I had heard of him since he arrived in France in spite of the fact his regiment being quite close. Am afraid the 9th and few days following were rotten days for a good many battalions, our lot as much as any. We have been “in” since the 8th and have had a fairly trying time we were reinforced during this week, not before time as we were down to our last two hundred. Can’t tell how sorry I am to hear about Joe as you say he was “one of the best”. I hope you chaps have not been annoyed at my not answering your very welcome letters. I don’t pride myself much on writing good yarns though and opportunities are also hard to find. As you know I had a bit of a knock at Neuve Chappell but have quite got over that and am now in the best of health and spirits. I came across Len Phillips and Peter Hawes in different drafts of the London Scottish while down at Rouen both of them have now had some experience on the job I expect. Thank Mr Drewe very much for making inquiries, tell him I occasionally wish heartily to be on the old job again the quiet life will do for me after this. No I did not get Dick’s magazine or letter expect it went astray while I was in hospital. Thank him very much for sending them will you. Had a game of football about two weeks ago with R.G.A.* Battery, the pitch being a serious drawback. I think it was a cabbage patch. Still we managed to get a good game in and most important of all, won. The weather here has on the whole been very good just lately only getting an occasional day’s rain. Last night we had a sharp thunderstorm, a new experience it had at least the effect of shutting all the other disturbances of our rest up so we did not grouse. Much obliged for all the information re the other fellows. Am glad most of them are getting on so well. Peacock seems to have come out top dog. The job alone from other examples seems to be a paying one, leaving out the holiday in Scotland. Well must close my epistle. Please remember me to Dick, Mr Horsley, Ransley and Drewe, Fox. Hoping both they, and yourself are, like myself O.K. [Line censored]. From yours faithfully,\\n\\nE.W. Bratchell',\n",
              " 'na_uk_12': 'Dear Effie,\\n\\nVery pleased to receive your letter, like yourself I find my correspondence voluminous for me at times, especially since I have taken on the duties of Platoon Sergeant which takes up more time than one realises at first. We are still in the trenches and have been in action twenty four days consecutively and I don’t know long we shall keep it up. Had a dirty time yesterday morning dodging damned great bombs the blighters were presenting to us without exaggeration they were eighteen inches to a two feet long and made a hole about ten feet deep and fifteen feet diameter at least we did not wait to see them burst. They can be seen descending through the air and then a scoot is made to get as far as possible round the corner, the iron and dirt seem to be falling for a minute afterwards, they are disturbing. Dicky Gilson has not been with us the last twenty four days, he broke his glasses and would not buy new ones (went to the doctor and all that and worked the oracle and was left behind with the Transport, don’t know whether he worked the ticket properly and got a safer job farther back, should not blame him if he has, his nerves have been in a shocking state, he’d brood a lot as you know that is absolutely fatal when you have a dirty job on like this. I have not seen either Frost or Kemball out here, do not seem to meet anybody fresh as we are always in the same district and relieve the same crowds generally.\\n\\nOur pals the French in my opinion scrap jolly well except in the isolated instances which are given undue prominence by our chaps by prejudice probably. The casualties have certainly been enormous but a lot of them are a week old and one cannot form any opinion of what is going on by the lists, and I should not be allowed to say what I thought of our doings lately. Cronin is still with the 5th Bedfordshires and not out yet, I think not likely to be in all probability. Only wish we could repeat our swimming performance off Penarth ‘specially the Wednesday evening ones. Have heard rumours of leave being given shortly but do not rely much on it, have been offered a Commission in this Battalion and I may take it up if my papers go through satisfactorily.\\n\\nKindest regards and wishes to Mrs Lewis,\\n\\nYour old Pal,\\n\\nBilly',\n",
              " 'na_uk_13': 'Dear Mr Hunt\\n\\nMany thanks for your long and interesting letter which I was very pleased to receive. I am sorry I have been unable to answer it before but I have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately, and have had no opportunity of writing letters. Well I am very pleased to say I am feeling very fit and well, and quite enjoying the life. When writing to you last, I was attached to the 4th Division and was stationed at a small village where we were living in tents. We were stationed there about six weeks. Just over a week ago I was transferred to another place about eighty miles from the other one. I travelled by motor lorry with the Supply column and it took us all day from 7.30am till about 9 o’clock in the evening to do the journey. It was a glorious trip, the scenery being very fine. Almost as good as our office outing, only not quite such comfortable travelling. We put up for the night in a small village, sleeping in the lorry with some empty petrol cans for a bed. Next morning I was taken to the railhead where I was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a week. While there we were all still sleeping in tents, but I was fortunate enough to have my meals with the Post Office Staff so have had a rest from being my own cook. Yesterday afternoon, just as I was going for my tea, I was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch a train to another railhead as I had to take charge as the A.M.F.O* for three Divisions there. As there is usually a man attached to each division, this was rather a large order. I only had about twenty miles or so to go, but it took from 5 o’clock till after 9pm to get there. These French trains are very rapid.\\n\\nI am now attached to the 51st (Highland) Division, the same division as Williams, a number of his lot were here today, but he was not with them. We shall probably only be here for a few days and will then move to another village further on. I was very surprised to hear of Mr Pritchard’s death. I also heard that Mr Crossley is also dead. We are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times. Glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section.\\n\\nI was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops that you are sending round the office and will certainly send you a photo later on. I have has some taken but have not received them yet. Have you heard from Ferdie or Gray at all? We all had our photos taken at Longmoor before we came out here a group of six. Unfortunately, I only had a few copies and they have all been sent away. Ferdie and Gray are still at the Base, I believe, but Arthur Smith is at one of the railheads somewhere. Well I don’t think I can tell you any more news at present. Will write again later and send photo.\\n\\nKindest regards to all.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\nM.P. Pond',\n",
              " 'na_uk_14': 'Dear Bertie,\\n\\nJust a few lines to let you know how I am getting on. Am having the time of my life out here.\\n\\nNo doubt you have seen the several letters I have written to the office during the past few months, so will not go into further details, except to say that I have been exceedingly fortunate in seeing so much of India in a short time. I shall never forget my trip through the Khyber Pass which has since been the scene of hard fighting, one consequence of which we were hurriedly moved from Fyzabad to Rawalpindi in readiness to reinforce.\\n\\nYou would scarcely credit the feeling of disappointment that exists among the few British regular regiments left in India, over not being ordered to France to take their share in the war. The same feeling also exists in the Territorials… A dragoon then left a few weeks ago to replace heavy casualties among the Norfolk regiment at the Gulf.\\n\\nAs the hot weather commenced the latter part of April, and as many British troops as possible are always sent to the hills (being almost unbearable on the plains), we are fortunate enough to go, and had a three days’ march and climb to this place 8,000 feet up. Well I never in any wild stretch of imagination ever dreamed that I should be soldiering in the Himalayan mountains.\\n\\nKuldana, although 8,000 feet up is on the lower Himalaya, and from my bungalow, which is situated on the edge of a steep precipice, I can see lovely views which words fail to describe, a perfect mixture of Devonshire, Scotch and Alpine scenery. Although seemingly only a few miles off, the higher snow clad ranges in full view are from 100 to 150 miles away. I have about 1½ miles trek to our Sergeant’s mess, through beautiful scenery, lovely wild rose bushes climbing up giant pink trees, smothering them in roses, maiden hair fern and all kinds of pretty flowers in the woods. The climate is perfect, lovely English summer weather, with delightful mountain breezes. The heat in India has not distressed me in the least, not even on long arduous marches. I am feeling splendidly fit and well, and trust I shall continue so. We have no end of gaiety; all the married families of the Yorkshire regiment are living in our barracks under our charge, (as their regiments had to remain behind at Pindi, and are being bitten to death almost with mosquitoes.) So we have Cinderella dances about three times a week, whist drives, racquet and tennis parties and have most enjoyable times.\\n\\nI wish May and Eileen could take an aeroplane trip of a few hours and get to me, it would be ripping for them. I should be glad to hear that you had called to see them on your promised visit of months ago when I was home, they would be awfully glad to see you both. Do drop them a card old boy. Fancy it is 10 months ago today since I left to go to camp, what a lot has transpired since then. I was in the 8th Middlesex 12 months ago, and I see they have lost heavily in France, funny I should have left them, and joined the 6th East Surrey and to pass them at Gibraltar (where they were first) on my way to India.\\n\\nOn the whole I am enjoying life in India immensely; I am acting Company Sergeant Major now, and expect to be promoted to the rank shortly. We are all ‘Tommies’ now. Trusting you are both fit and well. Remember me to Stacey. Yours sincerely,\\n\\nH. Beaumont',\n",
              " 'na_uk_15': 'Dear Mr Wheeler\\n\\nJust a few lines to let you know of my whereabouts. This is our fifth Sunday at sea. We left Southampton on Thursday October 29th shortly before midnight and our convoy of ten huge liners each with about 1700 to 2000 territorial troops on board assembled in the English Channel early next morning.\\n\\nWe were escorted by British warships as far as our first port of call- Malta the French warships to Port Said. After staying one night there we proceeded through the Suez Canal. We lay off the Port of Suez six days waiting for another escort then on through the Red Sea to Aden where we stayed four days waiting for our Japanese escort. When it arrived it brought with it an immense convoy of over 80 huge liners transports filled with New Zealand and Indian troops. This in addition to a convoy of thirty five vessels that came into Suez whilst we lay there. So it may truly be sung that “Britannia rules the waves.”\\n\\nIt has been a most delightful and interesting voyage and the weather is now so hot that hundreds of troops are compelled to sleep on deck nightly as the heat is much too great below. We landed two cases of fever at Aden. Fortunately it does not appear to have spread any further so far.\\n\\nWe expect to reach Bombay on Wednesday next, December 2nd then three or four days’ train journey to Fyzabad, some distance north of Lucknow. Shall be very glad to get there, as five weeks on board a crowded troop ship with very little opportunity for exercise is getting rather irksome, especially, when we get no ‘Daily Paper’, only a little wireless war news, occasionally.\\n\\nI am glad to say that I am wonderfully fit and well. Our food has been wholesome and plentiful. Trusting you are well, with my best wishes for as Happy a Christmas as is possible under prevailing war conditions, and a Prosperous New Year in due course. Also please convey same to Messrs Wood, Welsh, Davis and others. Hoping to see you again on the termination of our successful conclusion of the war.\\n\\nBelieve me, yours faithfully,\\n\\nH. Beaumont\\n\\nWill you also convey my respects to Mr Price please?',\n",
              " 'na_uk_16': 'Dear Arthur,\\n\\nI expect you are wondering why I have not written, but it is an awful effort to get all correspondence off, and be on active service at the same time. I can’t say that I am enjoying myself out here. It’s awfully hot, and we are eaten up by millions of flies. Life in the trenches is not a picnic either we have about four or five days out of them and eight or nine in them. When we are out supposed to be resting, we have to go on working parties, digging etc., then wherever we are, we are always under shell fire, so it’s not much rest after all. The last shell we had in camp, there was four killed and seventeen wounded.\\n\\nWe have been under fire for three months now, and we should like a rest as the strain is tremendous on one’s nerves. I don’t think the troops in France get it quite as bad. Then again, the only comforts we have are sent from home, as the country here is quite barren, and we cannot buy anything in shops, I would give a quid for a pint of beer down the club. Our food consists of half a loaf of bread per day, bacon and tea for breakfast, Bully beef and biscuits for dinner and Jam for tea and cheese. Lime juice is served out about four times per week, that is a drop is put into a dixie of water and a cup full served out per man, and rum is served out twice a week (sometimes) that is about four table spoonful each.\\n\\nWe live in a trench and it is a mercy it don’t rain otherwise we’d be washed away. The fighting just lately has been terrible. Our shells knock the enemy all ways and the sight in the trenches that we take is awful. We wear our respirators because of the awful smell of the dead. I’ll never get the sight out of my eyes, and it will be an everlasting nightmare. If I am spared to come home, I’ll be able to tell you all about it, but I cannot possibly write as words fail me. I can’t describe things.\\n\\nWouldn’t it be nice to be at Walmer again and you come down and see me again, I did enjoy that time, and also seeing Billy Dawson and Richardson. There seem to be a lot of French troops out here, but there seems to be no relief for us. Nobody loves us now Churchill has gone, we are nobody’s pets. It’s the army first here, except when there is work to be done, and then the Naval Division have to do it. You know both my brothers have commissions in the 4th Bedfordshires and are at Dovercourt. My wife tells me she has sent me three boxes of stuff, I received one box, and I fear that one transport has been floundered [sunk] and another has been torpedoed, so I expect that is where my other two boxes are. It’s awfully disappointing because I do look forward so to a bit of chocolate and a few biscuits from home. We get cigarettes and baccy served out to us, but it is too hot to smoke much, so that I don’t miss that so much. I get a bath in a biscuit tin when I can, but when in the trenches I have to go all the time without a wash, so you can tell I am used to being dirty.\\n\\nHow are they all down the club, and is Emmie still there, and is she better or not? Is Paice going to Looe this year? And where are you spending your holidays? Lord how I’d like a holiday, I am so tired and would give anything to get away from this continual banging.\\n\\nPlease remember me to all fellows who are left in the office. Mr Miller and Goff & Hills and George Williams, and all the boys generally. I can’t write to all separately, also for details of my experiences you must wait until I get back, if ever I do, of which sometimes I despair.\\n\\nThe papers tell you pretty full accounts, although they are rather anticipating events as to our advancing. Now I must close old chap, and thank you very much for all your kindness. Wishing you all the best\\n\\nYours very sincerely,\\n\\nHarold Watts.',\n",

I can imagine how lovely and empty the old room looks, fancy more flappers eh, quite a selection as you say. I will just give you an idea of our work here day by day. Reveille 6.00am, stables at 6.30-7.30, breakfast till 9.

Of course, sandwiched between this is probably a visit to Avonmouth Docks to fetch horses or take ours to the station for we only keep them for a week at the time just to knock the mud off and feed them up so as they get their shore legs and look a bit shipshape again. We have about 10,000 a week come in of horses and mules and some of them are fair devils, so wild and timid.\\n\\nI may come and see you probably Saturday if I get the weekend off…\\n\\nFatty',\n",

They cannot shave me because I have scraps of shell sticking in, and as I had not had a shave for about a week before I was wounded, I look a pretty picture.\\n\\nWell old chap, I am glad I am wounded to get out of that hell, and if you ever meet a chap that says he wants to go back call him a liar.\\n\\nIf you could manage to come down at any time I should be delighted. I have not received any letter from Dalton but perhaps will get it later. That will be the time old chap when I look into the office on my way home. We’ll manage to get a drink then.

              " 'na_uk_19': 'Dear Sir,\\n\\nI have now been out in France a fortnight. I am getting on quite well in the army. Food is also good and plentiful. Of course, I find the life much rougher from that which I have been used to, but it is a fine experience all the same.\\n\\nWe were at Longmoor camp for a week where we were equipped and put through elementary drills. We slept in a big hut there and had a sack of straw and three blankets each. The huts, of which ours was one, were called Apple Pie and they are about a mile from the camp, so we had to be up about six every morning in order to march down for parade at the camp. The parade was at 7.15am. Some mornings we had an hour’s drill before breakfast. It was about 11pm I should think, when we arrived at Longmoor on 31st March, and consequently we went straight to our hut. No light was provided so we had to fish about for our beds in the dark. Fortunately it was moonlight, and after some time a lantern was brought. We were only too glad when getting up time came the next morning. It was before six. We were marched down to the camp and were inspected by the Sergeant Major and after waiting some time went into breakfast. Roast sausage was the chief item on the menu but to our amazement no knives and forks were supplied for us…Well, the only thing was to convey the sausages to our mouths with fingers.\\n\\nThe nearest thing to a knife and fork that some had was a pair of nail scissors so these were used. Personally I did not know whether to feel shocked or to laugh at the situation; it ended in the latter. We Audit fellows got to one table and we had to have a good laugh before we could eat much. It was a hopeless situation to be in. Don’t let this discourage anyone from coming but I warn him to bring a knife and fork with him. After the first day we were issued with kits and we treasure our knives and forks now. We came across on the mail boat Hantonia from Southampton to Havre. … We had to sleep in huts there on the docks but the sleeping accommodation was better. We Audit fellows were able to keep together till last Saturday night, when Pond and I were sent off to different railheads. He is at 3rd Corps Railhead. We had to travel in horseboxes and during night time. We travelled in this manner Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights. French shunting is severe and we were shaken up. Saturday and Sunday we were about 30 in the trucks, Monday 17.\\n\\nWe were fortunate enough to get out into every town at which we stopped during the day. On Tuesday night another young fellow and I were stranded at a station somewhere in France, and we were instructed by the military authorities to sleep in the goods shed. We had to sleep on the deck of the shed and shunting was going on during the night. This was about the limit, I thought.\\n\\nI arrived finally at my destination about midday last Wednesday. Now I live in a truck at a small French station. There are two other Sappers and a Lieutenant here. We deal chiefly with gifts and comforts sent to the troops…\\n\\nWe are out in the country. I think this railhead is about seven miles from the firing line. Can hear the guns and see the star shells at night. I must ask you kindly to excuse me for writing in pencil because I have no pen and ink here. Would you mind letting this letter be treated as to the whole of the statistical department, please sir.

              " 'na_uk_20': 'My dear Mother,\\n\\nHave just come through a particularly nasty period. We went into the trenches on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning at 5am our Artillery commenced bombarding the German trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet. My goodness what a reception the Huns had in store for us, they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel. Poor old ‘C’ coy. caught it hot and Neuve Chapelle seemed to be a fleabite compared with this. It was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter, so I dug myself in and awaited events. It was horrible suspense, as I seemed to be the only man untouched, all around me, and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse, in fact, it’s all wrong to call them men, as they were mostly mere boys.\\n\\n About early afternoon I was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back. I replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way. So I commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet, then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top, nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me. We were relieved that afternoon, but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment… Billy Hastings is quite fit and the only pal left. We have been resting since and getting information about the (illegible) but by all reports we shall be up again soon. No rest for the wicked it is said, and if true we must surely be a bad lot.\\n\\nWhat a terrible thing about the Lusitania, and with so many Americans aboard. Should imagine there will be more trouble. Have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me. (censored.)\\n\\nAs regards the pads, (masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks), all we were served out with were made ‘on the spot’ and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda, prior to this charge. I lost all my belongings except the Gillette (razor) so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel. Do not trouble about towel and perhaps Frank would get me a shaving brush. Must now close. Much love to all. From your affectionate son,\\n\\nDick',\n",
              " 'na_uk_21': 'I am much nearer the front now, and we moved here last Tuesday. It was a long march and of course done at night, and our present billet is a farm (or the remains of one) in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches, more north than we were before, and nearer the Belgian frontier.\\n\\nIt is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire. This morning I was trying to get a sleep on the grass, when a shell burst in a tree, not fifty yards away, and sent a shower of leaves to the ground. Fortunately no one was hit, another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards, then I thought it was time to shift! So went into a barn. There are a number of dugouts around, but they are so cold, and you might get buried inside. The farm is a vile place, with a lot of stagnant water around, and a lot of German soldiers are buried here. The barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof, and ventilated it, in our absence! As the smell inside is bad, and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator! The rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of us.\\n\\nLast night was my first experience in the trenches, and we returned to billet this morning. The din is simply awful, and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy ‘beans’ every night. I am glad to say we had no casualties, although the rifle fire was heard at times, especially on our left, where the Germans made an attack on the Indian troops. The British gun fire was simply terrific, all night, and the Germans did not reply very much. It was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs, although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather ‘scaring’ to say the least of it!\\n\\nHowever the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful, and encouraging. Yesterday I came across an Indian soldier who could speak English very well, and he thought another month would see the war over, also a German officer captured near here, said it could not go on very much longer. I for one hope these remarks will prove correct!\\n\\nThe church here is practically demolished, just some of the walls and tower standing, and the churchyard is in a bad state. Great holes have been made and bones exposed. In these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody. Great stone vaults have been opened, and coffins and bodies can be seen.\\n\\nOf course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers. I have been through some of the big houses, and plenty of good carved furniture, pictures, fittings etc. still remain in them. I also have been in some of the gardens, and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers. I should like to see them at home!\\n\\nWell I must close now, and hope you are all keeping well. Again thanking you all for our good wishes. Sincerely yours, S. Frost',\n",
              " 'na_uk_22': 'Dear Nic,\\n\\nFirst of all I must thank you and… the others who sent me their kind letters of sympathy in regard to my brother Sam. We all felt it very much at home and it was a great shock to our parents naturally, but it can’t be helped, as he was killed in a good cause.\\n\\nI suppose you have heard how we left Bedford early on Sunday 18/7/15 and had a lovely trip down the old firm to Keyham, we were well laden and I was glad to get aboard and get to my berth in which I am very comfortable with two other Warrant Officers. The men and Sergeants are on the troop deck and none too comfortable but are jogging along alright now.\\n\\nThe first part of the voyage the sea was very quiet, we passed Gibraltar in a fog at night, so couldn’t see it. We then skirted the coast of Algeria and had a pleasant run to Malta where we stopped a full day. The higher officials went ashore for a few hours (including myself) and had a good time. I cannot mention troops or ships so refrain from doing so but there was a hell of a lot.\\n\\nOur next stop was Alexandria for three days, where we had another look round including a route march for the Battalion. The sea is fairly rough at this end, rather surprising, but a lovely colour, light blue at day and dark at night. All lights out at 8.00, perfect darkness, there is no twilight to speak of, being dark at 7.30pm.\\n\\nWe then wondered where we were off to but eventually reached Port Said, stopped a day, went ashore, and off we go to the Dardanelles which we expect to reach tonight.\\n\\nOur kits have been left behind in Egypt and all we have got we stand in. We are now passing through the Aegean sea, full of rocky islands, very much like the highlands of Scotland. Bullen has just lost his helmet over the side, but is otherwise well…\\n\\nI am in the best of health at present and hope to go through alright. I expect you heard I got married a week before I left, a lot of us did the same thing, it was quite a common occurrence.\\n\\nOur old boat is a captured German liner and is full up but we have got a Greek crew with a few Portuguese thrown in and so are a mixed lot, especially with Welsh men aboard.

              " 'na_uk_23': 'Dear Burgie,\\n\\nThanks awfully for your letter, glad to hear that you are all serene and that the G.W.R. is still flourishing without me, as a matter of fact I expect it’s better without me but still there you are.\\n\\nBy Jove! I had no idea that the Audit had shoved so many fellows into khaki, its fine. Well the old Brigade has had some pretty varied experiences in this land of stinks and bad beer.\\n\\nWe landed at Havre last March and after a freezing night under canvas on the heights behind the town we had a rather weird train journey up country. There were about 10 of us per cattle truck with a few wisps of straw to sleep on. Our horses were boxed six in a truck, three with their heads facing the ‘engine’ and three facing the rear of the train. Two men sat on corn sacks between their bottoms. If they kept the shutters closed they had a beautiful journey as it was so warm with the horses…\\n\\nAt about 2am the old caboodle pulled up and we thought we were in for a dreary hang about, however the order came down to bring out the dixies… and fall in for something hot. I took our one up and the liquid smelt so good that with a little judicious wangling we managed to get another one full. When we tasted it, it was simply gorgeous. Boiling hot coffee and rum as only Frenchmen can make it, you know how. Gee but it did go down a treat.\\n\\nWell after many jolts and bumps we arrived at our destination. It was miles from the firing line and a fearful hole at that. At nine next morning we were off again and went up further still, riding about 23 miles before we came to anchor at a rather dirty mining village…\\n\\nAfter about three weeks in this show we shunted up and got our baptism. It’s a funny sensation being under fire for the first time but it soon wears off. One gets a rather nasty jolt when the first casualty occurs especially as it was in our case the finest fellow we had on the staff. He got a chunk of shell in the back of his neck and was killed on the spot.\\n\\nWe were in action at this place for about two months and took part in several bombardments, one of them being the one in which poor old Joey was killed. We had some pretty rough times but were very fortunate as regards casualties. Two month’s action and 2½ days’ rest, it doesn’t seem much but that’s what we got, and then at it again in a different part.\\n\\nThis show had been occupied by the Germs and then by the French from whom we took over. The filth and stench was too awful for words, one of our batteries striking rather unlucky in coming across Germs buried just under the surface when they started digging their guns in. The air was blue for miles…\\n\\nThe next action we had was a hell of a show. The staff were put into a huge Chateau which was under observation and fire from three sides. And they didn’t half sling the lead about too. It’s marvellous that we didn’t get lifted skywards heaps of times, but still here we are. After a good spell in this show we came to rest again about 10 days or so ago.\\n\\nWe are having a good time here in the way of concerts, sports, boxing tournaments etc. The latter was great especially the bout between a Farrier Sergeant and a cook’s mate. They biffed at one another until neither could stand, it was awfully funny.\\n\\nLittle Seedy Ellis has got a snip job at a base. He came up today with a draught of men. He is having the time of his life and looks it by the dark circles under his eyes…\\n\\nI am feeling wonderfully fit and well and would not have missed coming out for quids. I suppose you saw in the paper that two of our boys have got the Distinguished Conduct Medal. They were in Major Lord Gorell’s Battery; he is awfully bucked about it.\\n\\nWell old man I must dry up. I hope you can read this disgusting scrawl, but will make that whiskered excuse ‘active service conditions’. Please remember me to all the boys and tell Long Liz that I would give anything for a barrel or two of the club bitter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDick James',\n",
              " 'na_uk_24': 'Dear Mr Rogers,\\n\\nJust a few lines to let you know I am still alive and have up to now succeeded in dodging those small pieces of lead which have been so frequently flying about the Peninsular [Dardanelles]. I expect you are wondering how I got here, also why Con. [convalescent] Camp. I will try and tell you briefly what happened since our leaving Egypt. We left Alexandria 13th August and landed at the new landing at Sulva Bay on the 18th under shell fire. Not a very nice kick off. Our first engagement was on the 21st when we took part in the big fight for Hill 70 and 971. I expect you read about it in the papers, for I see the Daily Sketch had a page full of it. They spoke of us as the Irresistable Yeomanry; very glowing words of our charge also. It was a very stiff go and we were fighting from 3pm the 21st until dark on the 22nd and never stopped advancing and retiring the whole time. We had the Hill on the night of the 21st but could not hold it, because no support was sent up, so the Yeomanry (those of us who were left) had to retire at night after charging and capturing three lines of Turkish trenches. Our Brigade (Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Dorset Yeomanry) was ordered to do the charging for the Division and I think we did fairly well from what the General said in his report. Of course we suffered pretty heavy. After five days on the Peninsular we did not have an Officer left in our regiment, and only barely half the men. I have seen a few of our Officers in the casualty list, but no men. I was very pleased to get the GRW Magazine while resting in dugouts on Chocolate Hill. I hope no more of the Audit boys have fallen since the last I saw. I suppose you are still pretty slack in the office. I find I’ve run away from the tale, but here in the Y.M.C.A. tent it is so crowded and the piano on the go, it is rather difficult to write. After resting from the big fight three days we went into the trenches for spells of five days, on one case seven days. After five weeks I caught dysentery and had to come away. I was put on a hospital ship and brought to St. Patrick’s Hospital, Malta. During those five weeks I was pretty lucky. The only close bullet was one through my right sleeve and grazing my arm. We all have some very narrow shaves from shrapnel. I had the sandbags of my dugout knocked down one day, but fortunately I was down to get water. Probably, if I had been inside I would have caught it properly. I expect to be here about a fortnight to three weeks before I go back. I am hoping the boys will be across before that, and the Turkish army cut in two.\\n\\nI suppose the office still looks more empty than it ever did. How is Mr Jackson getting on in France? I see his regiment has been in action. I have often wondered how he would get on in trench warfare. I suppose McConnel is still going strong. Will not stop for more now as I shall lose the mail. Kind regards to Mr Cox and all the men on the section. Hope you are still enjoying the best of health and still dodging the bombs. Hope to write again soon. Yours truly,\\n\\nE.J. Cowles.',\n",

I am not allowed to get out of bed yet, tried the other night and fell down in a fit serves me right for disobeying orders. I have the piece of shell which fractured my skull and shall look after it for a souvenir. The doctors say I was very lucky not to have been put right out. It was a heavy piece (British) would not have been wounded by anything less. We were in an advanced post sticking beyond our front line called the “Duck’s Bill” and naturally pretty close to the German trenches. In fact they surrounded us… [Lines censored]\\n\\nI hear from Bedford that the company has been told to prepare for the Dardanelles. I don’t know where he is though, have heard nothing from him.

Don’t know how to get on.\\n\\nSo you had Peter Jackson up to see you a short time ago. Lord, how I wish I could get up to London. Some of our chaps have leave but this advance seems to have put a stop to it. That’s the only reason I am sorry for the long awaited advance. God knows it was really time we did do something if only to relieve the pressure on Eastern front. We are in this part of the line and are still sitting tight worse luck. I wish they would get a move on here as well. It has cost us a good many casualties, but I think the Germans, what with the bombardment they got and the counter attacks they delivered must have lost many more than us.\\n\\nI have got an interesting souvenir. It is part of the framework of a German aeroplane, the fourth which our airmen have recently brought down in this neighbourhood. The machine gun in one of our planes had killed the German pilot and the machine getting out of control exploded, or at least the engine did, and the whole aircraft crashed to earth. God, it was an awful mess. Both the pilot and observer were killed, the former being bashed out recognition, but the latter survived the fall but died shortly afterwards. Our airmen seem to be the masters of the Germans now, although the taubes seem to be the faster machines, our men seem to have much spirit and initiative.\\n\\nAbout a fortnight ago I saw a fleet of fourteen of our planes cross over our lines on a raiding expedition. They were in close formation, and the Germans sent up a rain of shells without doing any damage. The raid was very successful, I believe, two transport trains full of German reinforcements being wrecked, a large station destroyed.\\n\\nWell that’s about all from me, let me hear from you soon. How is everybody up there? Best regards to all the section,\\n\\nYours very sincerely, Gilbert Williams',\n",
              " 'na_uk_27': 'Dear Dada,\\n\\nMany thanks for the Slough paper and magazines. Was very sorry to see that Jefferies and How have lost their lives. I heard from Arthur this morning and he tells me that Fred Blane has died of wounds in the Dardanelles. I expect you remember him in the “Windsor Operatic Society”. [Line censored]…\\n\\nHarold White (Ginger) who lived with Arthur has joined the Royal Artillery Garrison and is now at Plymouth. Arthur has sold the motorbike. Petrol is too expensive he says. Since I wrote last I have been moved to a little village about 2½ miles out of the town I was in then. It is a dead and alive hole with only a few houses and two cafes, only one of which is open. The other has had all the windows blown out.\\n\\nWe expect to move further on still in a day or two. We have changed our truck for a much larger one and have made ourselves very comfortable. It is about 30 feet long, so we have divided it off (with our ground sheets for curtains) at one end to make a bedroom, and the rest of the truck we have fitted up with desks and cupboards. I spent the other evening making a table out of bacon boxes etc. At present we are living very well indeed, with bacon and kidneys for breakfast, steaks and vegetables for dinner, jam and honey etc. for tea and bread and cheese and pickles for supper. Not bad for “active service”. The Post Office cook still does all our cooking. There are four of us on the staff here now. One attached to each of the three divisions, and one learning the work who will probably leave soon to take charge of a division. There have been plenty of aeroplanes over here lately. A German came over the other evening and our people shelled it for about half an hour. I don’t know whether it was brought down or not. I had a nice long letter from Mr Hunt yesterday. He sent me photo of the “Roll of Honour” and told me all the latest Audit office news.

While I think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly Magazine for August ’15, will you send me a copy, as I have not seen it.\\n\\nWell, we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for. The Huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with Jack Johnson* shells, shrapnel, whizz bangs* (terrible things) and trench mortars, blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up. The General Officer Commanding has complimented us on our behaviour. We are now resting at a place called Vlamertinghe, just south of Ypres and a couple miles North of Poperinghe [Poperinge] in Belgium. We deserve a rest for we have spent thirty-nine days in dugouts and the trenches (except three days) and needless to tell you we are very crummy, which tends to spoil the rest we are having. I never thought I was going to another phase of them after South Africa. I was in Poperinghe (where I met Jackson a few weeks ago)…\\n\\nThe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink, and also have one with him. I suppose shall have to wait for my increase, being an absentee from the office, anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for I shall then be able to pay more income tax. I enclose a few postcards. They are showing in each card before and after, or during and after the bombardment of Ypres, so you can guess what the place looks like.

I ought not to be left with a short leg as there is about 40lb weight on the end of it, in fact I should not be surprised if it finishes off ahead of the other. One good thing is I get very little pain except when I am moved.\\n\\nDid you get my postcard? I haven’t had an answer yet but expect letters take a long while. I believe I asked you to send me some fruit but as things take such a long while to get here I am afraid it would be bad, besides they take French money here, and as I drew £5 from the Field Cashier only a few days before I was wounded I am quite well off and the orderly will buy fruit for me in the town.\\n\\nI expect you are surprised to get a letter when I said on the post card that I should only be allowed to write once from this hospital, but a fresh order has come out and one letter a month is allowed.\\n\\nWell, I have written quite enough about myself I think. I am longing to get a letter from you and mother, it seems ages since I heard from you. Have you taken a house in Uxbridge yet or are you waiting until Auntie and Uncle move there. I do hope you are getting a little more used to the lonely house. Please remember me to everybody and give my love to all relations next time you write and tell them I should like to hear from them if they would write although I shan’t be able to answer their letters. Have you heard how Frank is getting on, I meant to write him but put it off too long.\\n\\nI expect my kit has been sent home, hasn’t it? I am afraid your field glasses are lost as I left my equipment in the wood when I was hit. I am awfully sorry if they are but perhaps one of the men picked them up. I arrived here with only one boot and only one puttee, so will you send me a pair of puttees and a tie out of my kit.

              " 'na_uk_31': 'Several months ago, when we relieved the French of these trenches it was noticed how quiet the ‘atmosphere’ was, and it seemed quite in keeping with the beautiful hilly scenery. Since the British occupation however, things here have livened up considerably, and it has been found necessary to greatly strengthen the trenches, and make dugouts much deeper and safer, because of the various kinds of souvenirs sent over from the enemy.\\n\\nTheir latest was the aerial mine, of which no doubt you have read. It is exactly like an oil drum to look at, with wood ends, and explodes with a terrific report. I don’t think it can be fired from a gun, as it comes tumbling across in such an awkward manner.\\n\\nI don’t think we manufacture these articles at Woolwich as we can afford decent shells! We are not troubled very much by German artillery, but they make up for that with trench mortars and rifle grenades.\\n\\nAs a signaller I escape some of the hardships of trench life, especially now the winter has arrived, and much prefer duties which keep one under shelter to those of exposure at the parapet! Of course we have exciting times, when any wires are cut by trench mortars etc. and which need to be repaired at once wherever the break is.\\n\\nJust lately I am having a lot of experience at making and fitting fireplaces in dugouts. We generally use biscuit tins to hold the fire and rummage among old houses in the village nearby for pieces of piping to take the smoke out, usually through the entrance as it is impossible to cut a hole through the roof on account of the sheet of iron. Fuel for burning is generally a problem but a small supply of coke is allowed and we add to it all kinds of wood etc. When sitting up at night it is surprising what good time we keep when waking up the next fellow to carry on, if there is no fire, but if a good fire is on, we get quite generous, and don’t mind allowing the next man an extra hour or so to sleep!\\n\\nWe have had several days of rain this week, which doesn’t tend to improve life in the trenches, or out. On our journey to billets last Saturday night, we took a road through a wood constructed by the Royal Engineers. It wasn’t quite finished, and in places was ankle deep in water, so our march was more of a paddle. Parts of this wood, which is in a valley had been purposely flooded, so the road had to be laid on faggots and will be a piece of work when finished.\\n\\nWe are fortunate in having dry billets, with beds raised above the floor and a small fire. Sheep skin coats have been issued to us, and are very warm. There is a fellow here now imitating a monkey and holding out a small cup to an audience seated on the beds, while another chap is playing an accordion! All we need now are top boots (tall rubber waders or gum boots designed to try and avoid the problem of trench foot) to paddle through the trenches! There is plenty of water about but very little to drink or wash in. It is a fine place for people who are good at finding excuses for not washing! But there are very good hot water baths here, only it isn’t any good having a bath unless one really needs it, on account of the colour of the water!!\\n\\nWe do very well though, for food and clothing both of which are good, and well supplied, and considering the many distant places it is sent from, it speaks well of the splendid way our Navy is doing ‘its bit’…',\n",

Well so far as a little internal trouble I’m keeping fairly fit now that the cold weather has started, and on my present job I can doctor myself, I am prepared to stick this campaign until further orders.\\n\\nWe are now in our winter quarters and a very nice place it is. Right on the edge of the cliffs, with a beautiful sea below, it reminds me very much of Cornwall. Then just across is the island of Imbros, and the sunlight on those mountains is sometimes marvellous. On a quiet, warm day, with the birds singing, one wonders if there is a war on, but the blooming shells soon drive that idea away. It’s jolly cold now though, but we have been served out with nice thick underclothes, and waterproofs, and top boots and except for always living in the ground, our comforts have been looked after as far as possible. Our food is as good as anyone could want, also I’m now used to a lot that before I’d turn my nose up at, and so long as the ships can land the goods I don’t think we shall be so badly off.\\n\\nMind it does blow, and the sea gets awfully rough and then no ships can come near us. We have the sea on three sides and the Turks on the fourth, so we are truly between the devil and the deep sea. The Turks still find some ammunition from somewhere whether our guns and the warships knock the very dickens out of them. It’s very exciting to watch a battle especially now it’s on our side the guns are not like at Antwerp where we were the ones potted. Now I am too sleepy to continue and as the firing has quieted down I’m going to sleep and continue tomorrow.\\n\\n5/12/15. I’ve not had a chance to finish this letter before, so here goes. We’ve had snow and rain and thunder and such lightening, and Lord it has been cold, everything frozen and even the water in my water bottle. But today has been beautifully mild and calm, almost like summer again. I have just received a packet of letters from my wife, written at different times since May, so am still in hopes that there may be some more back dates knocking around the world for me. We had three men killed last night in a little spasm, and today our guns and the Turks have been flinging dirt at each other. We used to duck once upon a time, as the shells came over, but now everyone seems curious to see what sort of a burst it will be and how much dust is knocked up, and heaps have cameras taking photos.\\n\\nEnclosed is a bit of heather which grows in great profusion all over the peninsular.

Do you know but, it’s quite an effort to remember the routine now…\\n\\nI suppose Mr Millow is still with you and is there any chance of H.R.H. Goff joining say as a S.C. (probably Senior Clerk)? There is now a singing in the air and bang just as I write they’ve dropped one over to us. Sometimes a shell bursts, and when we are working at something we don’t even know it’s come along. It’s funny what you can get used. But to get back to the office. I expect you have heaps of ladies there now, lord I haven’t seen a woman since April. What do they look like? I expect they scent out the office, and how careful you all must be not to swear. We often laugh here at the thought that if ever we do return to civil life again, we’ll be digging a little hole in the garden to live in and stirring up our tea with a bit of stick or our finger and just spit on the floor when smoking and if a little tickling in our shirt, just hopping it off in the street.\\n\\nI am out of paper (he is writing this on envelope), but it don’t matter. How are the lambs going? Here’s one that’s doing a little doing a little bleat far from home. I’d like to come you know, and have a rub at a bed and a roof, also a drop of beer perchance. Living in a hole for seven months now and the blue sky above gets a bit monotonous at times especially when the dirt will persist in falling on your face when you are trying to sleep and when it rains you’re up to your knees in no time, and that’s always at night. We had rum served out tonight and do you know, I can’t bear the stuff, just pause and think by the wayside, I can’t drink rum, in fact I hate it. How we do change by time. Now how is everyone down the club? Remember me to Emmie and Mrs Fellows and May. I understand that Mr Welsh and Mr Davies have been awfully kind to my wife, and I reckon its jolly good of them. This war seems to have found me so many kind friends, I don’t know what I’ll do to repay them all if I live through this…\\n\\nWhat has become of Beaumont and Jackson, and is my pal Jimmy Edwards still alive,… Bert I’d like to send you a Turkish shell but the post office won’t accept them for transit, anyhow perhaps I’ll bring home a nose fuse for a paper weight. Do you know back in the summer I had a shell drop just off the seat of my trousers and it did not explode. Kaw! It was a bit of luck, I didn’t stop to pick him up though, in case he changed his mind later.

It was very interesting to see the great\\namount of artillery, busy practically all day and night, and to read their\\nmessages sent by visual signalling [often using lights] from a ridge across\\nthe valley.\\nOur period in reserve being up, we moved to Mametz Wood to lie there in\\nsupport for five days, before going into the trenches at High Wood. On\\narrival at the edge of the wood at night, we were welcomed by a big dose\\nof gas shells and shrapnel, which was applied steadily throughout the\\nnight by the German artillery. Having to assist in putting our signalling\\ngear into a hole for safety, I was prevented from using my respirator for\\nthe first quarter of an hour, as we could not see on account of the\\ndarkness and dust made by the ammunition columns rushing along the\\nroad, and it was during this time that I must have breathed in enough gas\\nto put me out of action. Afterwards of course respirators were used, when\\nwe were settled in holes by the roadside for the night.\\nI remained with the battalion until I was sent to the casualty clearing\\nstation on August 3rd and reached Rouen hospital the next day. I had to\\nwait until the 9th and crossed the channel from Havre to Southampton on\\nthe New Zealand ship Marama, with about 800 other patients, the day\\nafter. It was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying wounded\\nmen, and the sisters and orderlies were colonials.\\nIt was last Friday week when I arrived here, and must say it is very\\ncomfortable and quiet. I had to remain in bed until last Saturday, but of\\ncourse I cannot do any route marching yet! So I have to take life quietly,\\nwhich is no hardship I can assure you after France. I am on an ordinary\\ndiet, and taking medicine.\\nI hear you have Mr Symons back again, is that so? And is he back in the\\nsame old spot? I hope he is pretty fit, although I suppose there must be\\nsomething wrong with him, to be back again.\\nI suppose things are as quiet as usual with you. Have you had your\\nholidays yet? This is about your time I believe. I shall be glad of a few\\nlines when you have time, to hear the latest about the office. I hope you\\nare keeping fit, also Mr J.B. Taylor and Mr Woodhams and with kind\\nregards to you all. Yours sincerely,\\nFrosty.\\nP.S. It is a treat to write a letter without the censor’s shadow over one!',\n",
              " 'na_uk_35': 'Dear Mr Hunt,\\nThanks very much for your letter which I received a week or two ago, also\\nfor the magazine.\\nWe are in the trenches just now. In fact we seem to spend about three\\ntimes as much time in as we do out. Also we are in a pretty warm spot, it\\nwas about here, towards the end of last summer that the French and\\nGerman had some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The country around\\nabout is a veritable maze of trenches. The fighting at one time was so\\nfierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the\\ntrenches, and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly\\nseeing the bones of men’s legs or their boots, or skulls sticking out from\\nthe sides of the trenches, pleasant, eh? There will be a pleasant smell\\nhere in the summer. I only hope we are not here then. In places we are\\nonly about twenty yards away from Fritz and company. Consequently all\\ntimes the air is pretty thick with bombs, grenades and trench mortars.\\nThese last are pretty hellish sort of toys. They have an explosion like\\nabout ten earthquakes rolled into one. But even these are not the worst\\nwe have to put up with. The trenches being so close together there is of\\ncourse any amount of mining going on. So one never knows when the\\nparticular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through\\nthe solar regions. When a mine does go up, there is some excitement\\nknocking about I can tell you. Suppose for instance we were going to\\nexplode one, all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot\\nand directly the mine is exploded, there is hell let loose on the crater. Of\\ncourse as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies, so that the air is\\nfairly full of everything that kills quickly. One can on these occasions\\nalways rely on a good many casualties. Since we have been in this spasm\\nthere have been five exploded in this neighbourhood, while others are\\nexpected to go up at any time. So much for conditions here.\\nHow is everything in town? Pretty quiet I suppose. I see you’ve had the\\nzepps (Zeppelins) over again? Is it a fact that one dropped in the\\nThames? (Lines censored.)

I received a letter on\\nTuesday 3rd of January 1917 which you sent to me on August 24th 1916.\\nBy the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments\\nand officers, but it has arrived quite safe at last. I received the letter you\\nwrote in October quite safe. I am sorry I have not written before but we\\nwere rather busy when I received your last letter and we could not send\\nmore than a field card for about a month. Well I am pleased to tell you\\nthat I am still going on first rate. I expect you will be surprised to hear\\nthat I have left the Northamptonshire Regiment and am now attached to\\nthe Army Printing and Stationary Services. We are opening a new branch\\nin the photography line and I am here as a photographer.\\nI am unable to tell you more than this up to the present. I expect Harry\\nwill be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in\\nthis respect.\\nThere are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms\\nare not finished yet we are having an easy time. The Officer is away in\\nEngland just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are\\non our own and I am in charge.\\nWe are billeted with a company of Australian electricians, mechanics,\\nmining and boring engineers and are having a fine time. There are a good\\nlot of fellows and make us very welcome. We had a grand Xmas with\\nthem and they know how to enjoy themselves. You can understand what\\na change this is after being in the line. Just before I came on this job we\\nhad over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when\\nthe weather was favourable.\\nWe went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then\\nback again. The water was over our knees in the trenches and it was\\nimpossible to use the communication trenches at all. We were holding the\\nfront line with two platoons (I should say our boys’ section of the line).\\nOur platoon was twenty two strong including the Officer, and during the\\nbombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes. There were no\\ndugouts of any description there, so you can imagine what it was like to\\nstand there for four nights. We hoped the weather would be alright so\\nthat we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be. We were\\nout digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas\\nshells, we had two chaps hit with them and put right out.\\nThe sights and smells were awful, as a good many of the chaps lay just as\\nthey fell during the advance. It was impossible to bury them. Also there\\nwere about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed\\nby shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns. Our guns never\\ncease down there, as soon as one section stop, another lot open out so\\nyou can tell there is Somme noise.\\nThe last time we came out, was for forty eight hours’ rest then in again\\nand over, but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent\\nin a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in\\nour division went over in our place.\\nWe were held in reserve and I am glad to say not required after all. Well I\\nthink this is about all, for now, I have been with the A.P. & S.S. since\\nDecember 1st and I can tell you, I hope I shall stop here. I have no desire\\nto go back to the line.

              "'dear mr welsh,\\n\\nwe were only out here a matter of a few hours before we went into the trenches; we were there for eight days and then came on to what is called a rest camp. i suppose it is called that to distinguish it from the trenches because the men are at work all day road and trench making and it comes under both rifle and artillery fire. we got here at 7 o’clock yesterday morning and were shelled at 9 o’clock.\\n\\nin the trenches it was fairly bad, they are so narrow and smelly and one is being potted at and shelled all the time. a turn of eight days was really quite long enough because it is strenuous work and even when you do turn in for a rest you have to be ready to turn out at once on an alarm.\\n\\nthe country is really quite pretty and just like the hills and valleys of south wales, but there are no brooks or rivers. it rains hard for a month each year usually about this time and then there is no more until the next rainy season. but although it is so gloriously sunny something is wrong with the place and it really isn’t as healthy as it looks. i think the flies have something to do with it as well as the heat and the still unburied dead bodies about. there are millions and millions of flies here and they are all over everything. put a cup of tea down without a cover and it is immediately covered with dead ones, they are all round your mouth and directly you open it to speak or to eat in they pop. it is a game. we have all got nets of course, we should have been worried, no medicine by now if we hadn’t.\\n\\nwe get plenty of bully beef and army biscuits, but bread and fresh meat is still a luxury and it is not possible to buy anything. it must have been a “no man’s land” because there are no houses or buildings of any kind to be seen and except the flies, the only living things are green canaries and lizards.\\n\\nwe live in dugouts built up the reverse sides of the hills. they are just holes really, but all the same they can be made very comfortable with a bit of digging and a few waterproof sheets. they are not shell proof by any means and the one i slept in during my first night here was knocked in completely by a shell pitching right into it. fortunately i was not at home at the time. we have another now and i must try and get a photo of it and let you see what it is like. i must send you one of our\\n\\nmess dugout too.\\n\\neverything here is named after the regiment responsible for the making or taking. for instance the road we made from our trenches to this camp is called “new bedford rd” and the ridge we took and now occupy is called on the army maps, bedford ridge. i have just been filling in and colouring my map and find it is one of the most, if not the most, advanced line of the lot. standing on that ridge it is possible to see what a lot of country we have taken and now hold, but there is nothing to get wildly excited about. each position is strengthened as much as possible before another attempt is made to push on and the whole thing is just steady progress. something might happen suddenly, i only hope it does.\\n\\nwe have had some very big ships out here and they have been bombarding the forts heavily now for some few days, and there are cruisers, monitors etc. standing in the bay helping the land batteries to shell the trenches. you see a flash and then wait a long time before hearing the boom and the shriek of the shell passing over our heads, almost together, then look round quickly and see the burst of the shell in or over the trenches sometimes before hearing the explosion. the first we know of shells aimed at us is the bang of the explosion, and it is too late to get out of the way. three officers were laid flat on their backs the other day without any hurt except to their dignity and farther on six men were buried without one being injured. it isn’t always like that though.\\n\\nthere is quite good bathing here when we can find time to go. as the beach is in full view of the enemy, and comes under their shell fire, it would not appeal to the nervous. we never keep closer together than ten yards when we are undressing and swimming in hopes that the turk will not consider one man worth the price of a shell. we have had some casualties through the men keeping too close together, but after washing out of a teacup for a week or more it is worth a bit of risk to get rid of some of the trench dust and smell and feel and look clean again. and really is the best bathing i’ve ever had. the water is quite warm and clear.\\n\\nall the hospital work is done on board a ship that stands in the bay. if the cases are serious or lengthy they are transferred to one of the hospital ships that calls daily and then go to either one of the bases or back to england. we land troops night or day in spite of the fact that they come under fire so it is possible for a man to be on his way back wounded, by the same ship that bought him from the base, without ever having landed.\\n\\nwe had a grand voyage out. all the officers had either staterooms or 1st class cabins and the food mostly was just the same as we should have had on an ordinary cruise to india or australia, wherever it is that the cruise line calls. the usual cabin stewards and waiters were in attendance and it was difficult to remember that we were not exactly on a pleasure trip. we did enjoy those two weeks…\\n\\nkind regards,\\n\\nyours sincerely,\\n\\nh.w. cronin, lieutenant.\\n\\ni am acting as captain until some of the others come back from hospital. dear nic (boyce),\\n\\nthanks very much for your interesting letter… i wondered when i would hear from someone at the office. also many thanks for your good wishes and congratulations on my marriage which i have conveyed to my wife. i am sure she will thank you all very much.\\n\\nwell to tell you a little about our experiences, we started off mysteriously one sunday from devonport on the captured german liner derflinger, not a bad boat. the warrant officers had 2nd class quarters it was all right. food was very fair. submarine pickets* every night for one of the four companies, lights out… at seven or half past. stole by gibraltar at night in a fog expecting it to be torpedoed. we did reach malta in due course after skirting north african coast, spent a day there, went ashore, had a few drinks which we needed being very hot and then on to alexandria for three days, ashore every night, not a bad place, of course the lower men didn’t go, except for a route march on the saturday. our movements were kept very secret and we couldn’t find out what was to be done with our division, we then pushed to port said and had a day there. all of a sudden, we received orders to sail and soon found we were off to gallipoli as we were passing through the aegean sea, which is as you know full of pretty islands. some hours before reaching lemnos, the naval guns could be heard booming and we ran into the magnificent harbour there full of shipping and life. after a day there, we pushed on to imbros 4½ miles from sulva bay during the afternoon they treated us to a naval shelling of achi baba, which is really the other side of the peninsula, but they shoot over the hills and mountains here. it was a fine sight and many of our chaps went sick at once. at night (sunday 9/8/15) our good ship made for anafarta bay where a new landing had been effected two days before. 900 rounds, four days’ rations each, as much as a man is expected to carry and they dumped us over the side in lighters [a type of flat-bottomed barge] at 7am, a short journey through the boom defences and we were ashore waiting for something to turn up.\\n\\nbivouacked on the beach and were put on unloading lighters till about 10 when the turks spotted us and started shelling, two men killed and four wounded to start with and we lost a few more, wounded during the day although naturally we took what cover we could. i had one or two near me whilst getting a timber out of the hold of a lighter but managed to dodge them all right. at night my company received orders to take picks and shovels up into the firing line which was about five miles away half way up chocolate hill… well nic the 10th were soon in the thick of it as we advanced across the salt lake in extended order.\\n\\nrifle fire now we had to dodge and many of our chaps got hit rather seriously i have since found out. i was glad of a rest at the foot of the hill but had to push on again and deliver the goods, after feeling about in the dark for some time our guide led us in single file up behind the firing line, where we laid down, bullets were whistling round but we managed to escape them… the enemy were yelling for all they were worth and i was glad when our captain ordered us down again to the beach. this took us some hours and when we reached the place, the other three had gone up to reinforce the firing line, so up we went again the next day about 6pm, nearly all things are done here in the dark as we are in view all the time. we again advanced across the take from lala baba, my heels were nearly raw through new boots and i eventually had to rest for a fortnight later on. well on our right was a hill burning furiously with many a chap caught in the flames and so perishing (not our regiment).\\n\\nwe finished on rather a feathered bed and did not find the other company ‘til next day, it was a night, we were all parched with the heat, and no water. dried up and had to dig ourselves in, it’s no light job this hiding being… like an ostrich, ‘til you make a hole large enough to get into and make yourself head cover. dear lack,\\n\\nmany thanks for the photographs received. we all think they are good and on saturday the six of us had out photo taken here in a similar position– in khaki. the two pictures together should make a lasting memento.\\n\\nwe have had little spare time since we have been training here. having been through company drill mixed with route marches, physical drill, semaphore, knot tying and frog, long jumping etc. some of our men were able to go to town on saturday… but i myself with a few others have been under orders for overseas service now waiting to proceed, so popping up town seems out of the question for us. we are numbered in alphabetical order, and in the order we are sent out. we are now fully equipped. i enclose … postage for the photographs. if you are printing any more you might save me one as i am afraid i have spoilt mine, it got bent in my overcoat pocket on saturday. please remember me to all at the office…\\n\\nn. boyce dear bert,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know i am alright, hoping you are the same… at the present time we are in dugouts. the weather is simply awful, raining day after day and especially night after night…to tell you the truth, while writing this letter i am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change. we have got our winter fur coats and gum boots, but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine, for instance last night i was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon, which is number 37. it was pitch dark, no light allowed and in a strange place, well honestly i fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents. on a round of inspection this morning to see if all were ‘comfortable’ i was ‘blinded’ up hill and down dale, ‘sergeant this’ and ‘sergeant that’.\\n\\nhow can you expect men to live in this, and then to put a dampener on the lot, was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night. they took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so, but they could not find me, for the only thing that would shift me, after settling down, if i may call it that, would be a ‘jack johnson’ and then i would have no option.\\n\\nwhile in the trenches last week john and i were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full. the line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling, but one gets used to it. that, to give you an idea, is like sitting at paddington and hearing the engines screech.\\n\\nafter our stretch this time i shall be looking forward for a short leave for i have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance. well i must now conclude…yours sincerely\\n\\njack symons\\n\\np.s. every other home down near the rest camp is an estaminet (small french café) where they sell what they call ‘beer’, and as much as i like a drop of good beer i have given the stuff out here ‘best’ for is awful muc. dear mr hunt,\\n\\nplease accept yourself and convey to the other gentlemen my best thanks for the state express cigarettes. they are fine. oh what a picnic it is in the trenches just now. we have been in the trenches 10 days up to now, and except for the last two days it has been raining almost steadily. the result is mud, mud and yet more mud, knee deep in places. but luckily we have long top boots from trench wear, so that the mud does not worry as much, except that is making our feet as cold as ice… we have been issued with fur jackets so we can keep our bodies warm.\\n\\njust now the whole countryside is covered with snow and moving objects are distinguishable a long distance off. for instance this morning when i was on duty with the gun i could see the germans walking down a road away behind their lines. i had several bursts at them with the gun but they were out of range. made me damned mad i can tell you seeing the blighters and then not being able to lay them out.\\n\\nyou can’t realise the power one seems to possess when handling a maxim. personally i feel as if i could lay out the whole german army. we fire about a couple of thousand rounds every night into fritz’s trenches just to keep them quiet. they (the germans) have been trying to find the gun, both with their maxims and with shells, but up to now, they’ve not succeed. kind regards to everybody. yours very sincerely,\\n\\ngilbert williams. i might say we are all merry and bright and not down hearted yet.\\n\\ndear mr hunt,\\n\\nreceived card alright for which i must thank you very much. we are still at longmoor and no signs of moving as i have been made cook’s mate and had to work very hard all through xmas.\\n\\nsapper hodges as long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe, so as it went on, this was where i had my first escape. i was on sentry duty for a couple of hours, from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out. i did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly germans, however it had to be done, it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front, then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against. i fired about five shots at their flashes (the only target to aim at) then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death. i thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that. our casualties here amounted on the average, to about two per day killed, of course, we thought it terrible at the time at least i did.\\n\\nearly april saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a well-earned rest, which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast. the remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills. after dinner we put the “cap on” our rest (why so called i do not know) by having a route march for two hours. we spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to ypres, here we went in to support the canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days, during which time we lost several hundred men, nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded, we had to retire, the best part being that the germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood. we stayed here for about a week; then we got to work again, digging reserve trenches just behind the front line, building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemy’s high explosive shells and such like, working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime. one morning we were awakened by the most awful din, it seemed as though hell had broken loose, shells were falling like summer rain. and people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and i admit i took it with a grain of salt, could not be possible i thought, but such i was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 3.30am. this bombardment started and about half an hour later, i, with three others, were ordered to start reinforcing. we went up in fours, it being considered safer that way, half a mile over open ground we had to do, this being swept continually with shells, to give you a slight idea i can say the previous night, just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field, and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all, simply one mass of craters, varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces.\\n\\ni had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where i was, the force of the concussion [explosion] pitched me several yards to my left and i came down rather heavily, however i reached the first line without any further mishap, where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench. our honours were one v.c. (victoria cross), two d.s.o.  (distinguished service orders), one military cross and one or two d.c.m. (distinguished conduct medals).\\n\\nthe next day i paraded sick, my back paining me so much that i could not stand straight for a week after. i am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications. we are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the audit office. have you any news of chichester?\\n\\nyours truly,\\n\\n(rifleman) e.h.c. stewart this trench of ours is a model in its own way, being fairly safe, and connected by good communication trenches. the commanding officer’s house of white sandbags is fitted with window, curtains, and window box with pansies in it. it is furnished with table and chairs also a large mirror. of course this is quite a ‘one occasion’ affair and don’t imagine we are here town planning with model dwellings etc! but it will show you how soldiers can adapt themselves to circumstances. at the back of our trench is ripening corn and plenty of wildflowers in bloom.\\n\\nwe have also canaries in cages in the trench! but these are used by the miners for testing the air in the mines after the explosion, to see if it was possible to finish off their job. [censored line] captured from the germans a short time ago and during the stay we were kept busy with sandbags etc. and at night of course had to especially watch the enemy.\\n\\nwhen in the reserve or support trenches fatigue work has to be done every night, such as carrying food, ammunition, material for the engineers etc. to the firing line, so you can guess it is nothing but continual ‘bob’ work (odd jobs). dear mr hunt\\n\\nmany thanks for your welcome letter volunteering so much interesting news of friends at the office. i wrote to standew just before receiving your letter, but no doubt a few more lines will be acceptable.\\n\\nbeaumont seems to be doing the best of us all. i saw williams and hull about three weeks ago in a small town near here. of course the seaforths and argylls (regiments) always move about together, but we don’t meet very often. i am glad to hear the old section is still in being, and not like the german empire is fast becoming a thing of the past! and hope your three survivors will be allowed to keep the flag flying until the wanderers return.\\n\\ni have been in the firing line several times, and at four different places, besides being in the support trenches at others. i hear this is called a mobile division which accounts for our gipsy life in france.\\n\\nour last turn in the firing line, for six days and six in the reserve was the most exciting of all.\\n\\nit has been a quiet place for two months, until two days after our occupation, when the british exploded mines under some workings of the germans near their trenches, to prevent them blowing our trench up. well! that woke them up and the following saturday they retaliated by opening rapid fire early in the morning.\\n\\nhowever we were ready for them and quickly replied, so they then bombarded us, which to say the least of it was a noisy business. that eventually ceased and rapid firing was quickly in process again, followed by another shelling, which our guns again put a stop to. the whole affair lasted an hour and ten minutes, and although we believe an attack was intended, the germans didn’t leave their trench, opposite to us. after putting our trench in order again which took some time, as the parapet was blown down for about three yards near me, and a shell burst amongst a lot of beef tins, scattering them and the contents in all directions, besides the bottom of the trench being littered with hundreds of empty cartridges, we proceeded with boiling water for tea, also to show the huns by the smoke that we were still there. only a hundred yards separated the two trenches, so it was always a case of “bob down” and the enemy were good shots, as we found out to our cost when they smashed the top glasses in two periscopes within half an hour one morning.\\n\\nat present the division is resting, and i and two friends have erected a wee bivouac under an apple tree on a farm. it is quite cosy, in fine weather, but last night it was raining hard for several hours, so we had to beat a hasty retreat to an old barn. there is plenty of fruit about here, but the water supply is very bad.\\n\\nlast sunday morning we enjoyed our first hot bath since our arrival here. an old disused brewery has been turned into baths for troops, also under clothing is washed and disinfected, and kilts ironed there. fifty tubs are provided for washing in and two large vats filled with cold water to plunge into afterwards.\\n\\ni have not got any stripes yet, but have been studying signalling lately, so expect soon to be in the signal section.\\n\\ni must close now to get this letter away, hoping mr taylor, mr woodhams, and yourself are keeping well, and with kind regards to you all.\\n\\nyours very sincerely,\\n\\n‘frosty’ dear gerald\\n\\nmany thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me. no the news was quite fresh as i do not hear from anybody in the office.\\n\\nwe have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time. we were three days in the reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment.\\n\\ni am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and i can assure you it was an experience i shall never forget. anyhow williams, kemball and myself came out quite safely.\\n\\ni have seen frost out here, of course his battalion (8th argyll & sutherland highlanders) are in the same brigade also, as a matter of fact, they were in the firing line the night we came out. i received a letter while i was in the trenches from mr slater. yes, i heard about chamberlain, jolly sad was it not, if you do hear from dick james you might pass any news on to me…\\n\\nshall be glad to hear from you. i could write more, only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches.\\n\\ni am yours sincerely, fred hull.\\n\\np.s. of course you know my address. remember me to all i know. dear burgie,\\n\\nwas very glad indeed to get your letters although, your news in regard to joe comes as a shock. it was the first i had heard of him since he arrived in france in spite of the fact his regiment being quite close. am afraid the 9th and few days following were rotten days for a good many battalions, our lot as much as any. we have been “in” since the 8th and have had a fairly trying time we were reinforced during this week, not before time as we were down to our last two hundred. can’t tell how sorry i am to hear about joe as you say he was “one of the best”. i hope you chaps have not been annoyed at my not answering your very welcome letters. i don’t pride myself much on writing good yarns though and opportunities are also hard to find. as you know i had a bit of a knock at neuve chappell but have quite got over that and am now in the best of health and spirits. i came across len phillips and peter hawes in different drafts of the london scottish while down at rouen both of them have now had some experience on the job i expect. thank mr drewe very much for making inquiries, tell him i occasionally wish heartily to be on the old job again the quiet life will do for me after this. no i did not get dick’s magazine or letter expect it went astray while i was in hospital. thank him very much for sending them will you. had a game of football about two weeks ago with r.g.a.* battery, the pitch being a serious drawback. i think it was a cabbage patch. still we managed to get a good game in and most important of all, won. the weather here has on the whole been very good just lately only getting an occasional day’s rain. last night we had a sharp thunderstorm, a new experience it had at least the effect of shutting all the other disturbances of our rest up so we did not grouse. much obliged for all the information re the other fellows. am glad most of them are getting on so well. peacock seems to have come out top dog. the job alone from other examples seems to be a paying one, leaving out the holiday in scotland. well must close my epistle. please remember me to dick, mr horsley, ransley and drewe, fox. hoping both they, and yourself are, like myself o.k. [line censored]. from yours faithfully,\\n\\ne.w. bratchell dear effie,\\n\\nvery pleased to receive your letter, like yourself i find my correspondence voluminous for me at times, especially since i have taken on the duties of platoon sergeant which takes up more time than one realises at first. we are still in the trenches and have been in action twenty four days consecutively and i don’t know long we shall keep it up. had a dirty time yesterday morning dodging damned great bombs the blighters were presenting to us without exaggeration they were eighteen inches to a two feet long and made a hole about ten feet deep and fifteen feet diameter at least we did not wait to see them burst. they can be seen descending through the air and then a scoot is made to get as far as possible round the corner, the iron and dirt seem to be falling for a minute afterwards, they are disturbing. dicky gilson has not been with us the last twenty four days, he broke his glasses and would not buy new ones (went to the doctor and all that and worked the oracle and was left behind with the transport, don’t know whether he worked the ticket properly and got a safer job farther back, should not blame him if he has, his nerves have been in a shocking state, he’d brood a lot as you know that is absolutely fatal when you have a dirty job on like this. i have not seen either frost or kemball out here, do not seem to meet anybody fresh as we are always in the same district and relieve the same crowds generally.\\n\\nour pals the french in my opinion scrap jolly well except in the isolated instances which are given undue prominence by our chaps by prejudice probably. the casualties have certainly been enormous but a lot of them are a week old and one cannot form any opinion of what is going on by the lists, and i should not be allowed to say what i thought of our doings lately. cronin is still with the 5th bedfordshires and not out yet, i think not likely to be in all probability. only wish we could repeat our swimming performance off penarth ‘specially the wednesday evening ones. have heard rumours of leave being given shortly but do not rely much on it, have been offered a commission in this battalion and i may take it up if my papers go through satisfactorily.\\n\\nkindest regards and wishes to mrs lewis,\\n\\nyour old pal,\\n\\nbilly dear mr hunt\\n\\nmany thanks for your long and interesting letter which i was very pleased to receive. i am sorry i have been unable to answer it before but i have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately, and have had no opportunity of writing letters. well i am very pleased to say i am feeling very fit and well, and quite enjoying the life. when writing to you last, i was attached to the 4th division and was stationed at a small village where we were living in tents. we were stationed there about six weeks. just over a week ago i was transferred to another place about eighty miles from the other one. i travelled by motor lorry with the supply column and it took us all day from 7.30am till about 9 o’clock in the evening to do the journey. it was a glorious trip, the scenery being very fine. almost as good as our office outing, only not quite such comfortable travelling. we put up for the night in a small village, sleeping in the lorry with some empty petrol cans for a bed. next morning i was taken to the railhead where i was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a week. while there we were all still sleeping in tents, but i was fortunate enough to have my meals with the post office staff so have had a rest from being my own cook. yesterday afternoon, just as i was going for my tea, i was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch a train to another railhead as i had to take charge as the a.m.f.o* for three divisions there. as there is usually a man attached to each division, this was rather a large order. i only had about twenty miles or so to go, but it took from 5 o’clock till after 9pm to get there. these french trains are very rapid.\\n\\ni am now attached to the 51st (highland) division, the same division as williams, a number of his lot were here today, but he was not with them. we shall probably only be here for a few days and will then move to another village further on. i was very surprised to hear of mr pritchard’s death. i also heard that mr crossley is also dead. we are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times. glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section.\\n\\ni was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops that you are sending round the office and will certainly send you a photo later on. i have has some taken but have not received them yet. have you heard from ferdie or gray at all? we all had our photos taken at longmoor before we came out here a group of six. unfortunately, i only had a few copies and they have all been sent away. ferdie and gray are still at the base, i believe, but arthur smith is at one of the railheads somewhere. well i don’t think i can tell you any more news at present. will write again later and send photo.\\n\\nkindest regards to all.\\n\\nyours sincerely,\\n\\nm.p. pond dear bertie,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know how i am getting on. am having the time of my life out here.\\n\\nno doubt you have seen the several letters i have written to the office during the past few months, so will not go into further details, except to say that i have been exceedingly fortunate in seeing so much of india in a short time. i shall never forget my trip through the khyber pass which has since been the scene of hard fighting, one consequence of which we were hurriedly moved from fyzabad to rawalpindi in readiness to reinforce.\\n\\nyou would scarcely credit the feeling of disappointment that exists among the few british regular regiments left in india, over not being ordered to france to take their share in the war. the same feeling also exists in the territorials… a dragoon then left a few weeks ago to replace heavy casualties among the norfolk regiment at the gulf.\\n\\nas the hot weather commenced the latter part of april, and as many british troops as possible are always sent to the hills (being almost unbearable on the plains), we are fortunate enough to go, and had a three days’ march and climb to this place 8,000 feet up. well i never in any wild stretch of imagination ever dreamed that i should be soldiering in the himalayan mountains.\\n\\nkuldana, although 8,000 feet up is on the lower himalaya, and from my bungalow, which is situated on the edge of a steep precipice, i can see lovely views which words fail to describe, a perfect mixture of devonshire, scotch and alpine scenery. although seemingly only a few miles off, the higher snow clad ranges in full view are from 100 to 150 miles away. i have about 1½ miles trek to our sergeant’s mess, through beautiful scenery, lovely wild rose bushes climbing up giant pink trees, smothering them in roses, maiden hair fern and all kinds of pretty flowers in the woods. the climate is perfect, lovely english summer weather, with delightful mountain breezes. the heat in india has not distressed me in the least, not even on long arduous marches. i am feeling splendidly fit and well, and trust i shall continue so. we have no end of gaiety; all the married families of the yorkshire regiment are living in our barracks under our charge, (as their regiments had to remain behind at pindi, and are being bitten to death almost with mosquitoes.) so we have cinderella dances about three times a week, whist drives, racquet and tennis parties and have most enjoyable times.\\n\\ni wish may and eileen could take an aeroplane trip of a few hours and get to me, it would be ripping for them. i should be glad to hear that you had called to see them on your promised visit of months ago when i was home, they would be awfully glad to see you both. do drop them a card old boy. fancy it is 10 months ago today since i left to go to camp, what a lot has transpired since then. i was in the 8th middlesex 12 months ago, and i see they have lost heavily in france, funny i should have left them, and joined the 6th east surrey and to pass them at gibraltar (where they were first) on my way to india.\\n\\non the whole i am enjoying life in india immensely; i am acting company sergeant major now, and expect to be promoted to the rank shortly. we are all ‘tommies’ now. trusting you are both fit and well. remember me to stacey. yours sincerely,\\n\\nh. beaumont dear mr wheeler\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know of my whereabouts. this is our fifth sunday at sea. we left southampton on thursday october 29th shortly before midnight and our convoy of ten huge liners each with about 1700 to 2000 territorial troops on board assembled in the english channel early next morning.\\n\\nwe were escorted by british warships as far as our first port of call- malta the french warships to port said. after staying one night there we proceeded through the suez canal. we lay off the port of suez six days waiting for another escort then on through the red sea to aden where we stayed four days waiting for our japanese escort. when it arrived it brought with it an immense convoy of over 80 huge liners transports filled with new zealand and indian troops. this in addition to a convoy of thirty five vessels that came into suez whilst we lay there. so it may truly be sung that “britannia rules the waves.”\\n\\nit has been a most delightful and interesting voyage and the weather is now so hot that hundreds of troops are compelled to sleep on deck nightly as the heat is much too great below. we landed two cases of fever at aden. fortunately it does not appear to have spread any further so far.\\n\\nwe expect to reach bombay on wednesday next, december 2nd then three or four days’ train journey to fyzabad, some distance north of lucknow. shall be very glad to get there, as five weeks on board a crowded troop ship with very little opportunity for exercise is getting rather irksome, especially, when we get no ‘daily paper’, only a little wireless war news, occasionally.\\n\\ni am glad to say that i am wonderfully fit and well. our food has been wholesome and plentiful. trusting you are well, with my best wishes for as happy a christmas as is possible under prevailing war conditions, and a prosperous new year in due course. also please convey same to messrs wood, welsh, davis and others. hoping to see you again on the termination of our successful conclusion of the war.\\n\\nbelieve me, yours faithfully,\\n\\nh. beaumont\\n\\nwill you also convey my respects to mr price please? dear arthur,\\n\\ni expect you are wondering why i have not written, but it is an awful effort to get all correspondence off, and be on active service at the same time. i can’t say that i am enjoying myself out here. it’s awfully hot, and we are eaten up by millions of flies. life in the trenches is not a picnic either we have about four or five days out of them and eight or nine in them. when we are out supposed to be resting, we have to go on working parties, digging etc., then wherever we are, we are always under shell fire, so it’s not much rest after all. the last shell we had in camp, there was four killed and seventeen wounded.\\n\\nwe have been under fire for three months now, and we should like a rest as the strain is tremendous on one’s nerves. i don’t think the troops in france get it quite as bad. then again, the only comforts we have are sent from home, as the country here is quite barren, and we cannot buy anything in shops, i would give a quid for a pint of beer down the club. our food consists of half a loaf of bread per day, bacon and tea for breakfast, bully beef and biscuits for dinner and jam for tea and cheese. lime juice is served out about four times per week, that is a drop is put into a dixie of water and a cup full served out per man, and rum is served out twice a week (sometimes) that is about four table spoonful each.\\n\\nwe live in a trench and it is a mercy it don’t rain otherwise we’d be washed away. the fighting just lately has been terrible. our shells knock the enemy all ways and the sight in the trenches that we take is awful. we wear our respirators because of the awful smell of the dead. i’ll never get the sight out of my eyes, and it will be an everlasting nightmare. if i am spared to come home, i’ll be able to tell you all about it, but i cannot possibly write as words fail me. i can’t describe things.\\n\\nwouldn’t it be nice to be at walmer again and you come down and see me again, i did enjoy that time, and also seeing billy dawson and richardson. there seem to be a lot of french troops out here, but there seems to be no relief for us. nobody loves us now churchill has gone, we are nobody’s pets. it’s the army first here, except when there is work to be done, and then the naval division have to do it. you know both my brothers have commissions in the 4th bedfordshires and are at dovercourt. my wife tells me she has sent me three boxes of stuff, i received one box, and i fear that one transport has been floundered [sunk] and another has been torpedoed, so i expect that is where my other two boxes are. it’s awfully disappointing because i do look forward so to a bit of chocolate and a few biscuits from home. we get cigarettes and baccy served out to us, but it is too hot to smoke much, so that i don’t miss that so much. i get a bath in a biscuit tin when i can, but when in the trenches i have to go all the time without a wash, so you can tell i am used to being dirty.\\n\\nhow are they all down the club, and is emmie still there, and is she better or not? is paice going to looe this year? and where are you spending your holidays? lord how i’d like a holiday, i am so tired and would give anything to get away from this continual banging.\\n\\nplease remember me to all fellows who are left in the office. mr miller and goff & hills and george williams, and all the boys generally. i can’t write to all separately, also for details of my experiences you must wait until i get back, if ever i do, of which sometimes i despair.\\n\\nthe papers tell you pretty full accounts, although they are rather anticipating events as to our advancing. now i must close old chap, and thank you very much for all your kindness. wishing you all the best\\n\\nyours very sincerely,\\n\\nharold watts. dear bertie,\\n\\nmany thanks for letters and fags both were very acceptable as you can imagine for it bucks one up to hear from old associates. i also had a letter from “tinker” taylor who told me gwen has left the great western railway company. i will write to ferdi [ferdinand] and ask frosty if you give me his address. i can imagine how lovely and empty the old room looks, fancy more flappers eh, quite a selection as you say. i will just give you an idea of our work here day by day. reveille 6.00am, stables at 6.30-7.30, breakfast till 9. then exercise ride one and lead two or three [horses] for one and a half hours, then groom them until 12.15, then we water and feed and go to dinner till 2.30 then sweep up … [letter damaged]\\n\\nbed [horses] down at 4pm then water and feed at 4.15 to 4.30 and hay up at 5pm, only we take it in turns to do that and we have stables like this. [fatty has drawn a rough sketch of the stables which house the horses].\\n\\nwe have six and seven a side which leaves us four horses each. of course, sandwiched between this is probably a visit to avonmouth docks to fetch horses or take ours to the station for we only keep them for a week at the time just to knock the mud off and feed them up so as they get their shore legs and look a bit shipshape again. we have about 10,000 a week come in of horses and mules and some of them are fair devils, so wild and timid.\\n\\ni may come and see you probably saturday if i get the weekend off…\\n\\nfatty dear ernie,\\n\\nthanks very much for your letter and kind wishes. my wounds are getting on all right and they have discovered eleven in all. it is hard not to be able to get up, but i suppose a month will soon be slip by. my people came to see me yesterday and the day before.\\n\\nyou ought to see my face. they cannot shave me because i have scraps of shell sticking in, and as i had not had a shave for about a week before i was wounded, i look a pretty picture.\\n\\nwell old chap, i am glad i am wounded to get out of that hell, and if you ever meet a chap that says he wants to go back call him a liar.\\n\\nif you could manage to come down at any time i should be delighted. i have not received any letter from dalton but perhaps will get it later. that will be the time old chap when i look into the office on my way home. we’ll manage to get a drink then.  well i must close now and i expect you will have quite enough trouble to read what i have written already. hoping to be with you all,\\n\\nyour old pal, rip. dear sir,\\n\\ni have now been out in france a fortnight. i am getting on quite well in the army. food is also good and plentiful. of course, i find the life much rougher from that which i have been used to, but it is a fine experience all the same.\\n\\nwe were at longmoor camp for a week where we were equipped and put through elementary drills. we slept in a big hut there and had a sack of straw and three blankets each. the huts, of which ours was one, were called apple pie and they are about a mile from the camp, so we had to be up about six every morning in order to march down for parade at the camp. the parade was at 7.15am. some mornings we had an hour’s drill before breakfast. it was about 11pm i should think, when we arrived at longmoor on 31st march, and consequently we went straight to our hut. no light was provided so we had to fish about for our beds in the dark. fortunately it was moonlight, and after some time a lantern was brought. we were only too glad when getting up time came the next morning. it was before six. we were marched down to the camp and were inspected by the sergeant major and after waiting some time went into breakfast. roast sausage was the chief item on the menu but to our amazement no knives and forks were supplied for us…well, the only thing was to convey the sausages to our mouths with fingers.\\n\\nthe nearest thing to a knife and fork that some had was a pair of nail scissors so these were used. personally i did not know whether to feel shocked or to laugh at the situation; it ended in the latter. we audit fellows got to one table and we had to have a good laugh before we could eat much. it was a hopeless situation to be in. don’t let this discourage anyone from coming but i warn him to bring a knife and fork with him. after the first day we were issued with kits and we treasure our knives and forks now. we came across on the mail boat hantonia from southampton to havre. … we had to sleep in huts there on the docks but the sleeping accommodation was better. we audit fellows were able to keep together till last saturday night, when pond and i were sent off to different railheads. he is at 3rd corps railhead. we had to travel in horseboxes and during night time. we travelled in this manner saturday, sunday and monday nights. french shunting is severe and we were shaken up. saturday and sunday we were about 30 in the trucks, monday 17.\\n\\nwe were fortunate enough to get out into every town at which we stopped during the day. on tuesday night another young fellow and i were stranded at a station somewhere in france, and we were instructed by the military authorities to sleep in the goods shed. we had to sleep on the deck of the shed and shunting was going on during the night. this was about the limit, i thought.\\n\\ni arrived finally at my destination about midday last wednesday. now i live in a truck at a small french station. there are two other sappers and a lieutenant here. we deal chiefly with gifts and comforts sent to the troops…\\n\\nwe are out in the country. i think this railhead is about seven miles from the firing line. can hear the guns and see the star shells at night. i must ask you kindly to excuse me for writing in pencil because i have no pen and ink here. would you mind letting this letter be treated as to the whole of the statistical department, please sir. with kindest regards to all. i am yours obediently,\\n\\narthur smith my dear mother,\\n\\nhave just come through a particularly nasty period. we went into the trenches on wednesday night and on sunday morning at 5am our artillery commenced bombarding the german trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet. my goodness what a reception the huns had in store for us, they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel. poor old ‘c’ coy. caught it hot and neuve chapelle seemed to be a fleabite compared with this. it was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter, so i dug myself in and awaited events. it was horrible suspense, as i seemed to be the only man untouched, all around me, and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse, in fact, it’s all wrong to call them men, as they were mostly mere boys.\\n\\n about early afternoon i was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back. i replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way. so i commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet, then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top, nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me. we were relieved that afternoon, but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment… billy hastings is quite fit and the only pal left. we have been resting since and getting information about the (illegible) but by all reports we shall be up again soon. no rest for the wicked it is said, and if true we must surely be a bad lot.\\n\\nwhat a terrible thing about the lusitania, and with so many americans aboard. should imagine there will be more trouble. have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me. (censored.)\\n\\nas regards the pads, (masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks), all we were served out with were made ‘on the spot’ and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda, prior to this charge. i lost all my belongings except the gillette (razor) so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel. do not trouble about towel and perhaps frank would get me a shaving brush. must now close. much love to all. from your affectionate son,\\n\\ndick i am much nearer the front now, and we moved here last tuesday. it was a long march and of course done at night, and our present billet is a farm (or the remains of one) in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches, more north than we were before, and nearer the belgian frontier.\\n\\nit is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire. this morning i was trying to get a sleep on the grass, when a shell burst in a tree, not fifty yards away, and sent a shower of leaves to the ground. fortunately no one was hit, another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards, then i thought it was time to shift! so went into a barn. there are a number of dugouts around, but they are so cold, and you might get buried inside. the farm is a vile place, with a lot of stagnant water around, and a lot of german soldiers are buried here. the barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof, and ventilated it, in our absence! as the smell inside is bad, and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator! the rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of us.\\n\\nlast night was my first experience in the trenches, and we returned to billet this morning. the din is simply awful, and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy ‘beans’ every night. i am glad to say we had no casualties, although the rifle fire was heard at times, especially on our left, where the germans made an attack on the indian troops. the british gun fire was simply terrific, all night, and the germans did not reply very much. it was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs, although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather ‘scaring’ to say the least of it!\\n\\nhowever the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful, and encouraging. yesterday i came across an indian soldier who could speak english very well, and he thought another month would see the war over, also a german officer captured near here, said it could not go on very much longer. i for one hope these remarks will prove correct!\\n\\nthe church here is practically demolished, just some of the walls and tower standing, and the churchyard is in a bad state. great holes have been made and bones exposed. in these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody. great stone vaults have been opened, and coffins and bodies can be seen.\\n\\nof course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers. i have been through some of the big houses, and plenty of good carved furniture, pictures, fittings etc. still remain in them. i also have been in some of the gardens, and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers. i should like to see them at home!\\n\\nwell i must close now, and hope you are all keeping well. again thanking you all for our good wishes. sincerely yours, s. frost dear nic,\\n\\nfirst of all i must thank you and… the others who sent me their kind letters of sympathy in regard to my brother sam. we all felt it very much at home and it was a great shock to our parents naturally, but it can’t be helped, as he was killed in a good cause.\\n\\ni suppose you have heard how we left bedford early on sunday 18/7/15 and had a lovely trip down the old firm to keyham, we were well laden and i was glad to get aboard and get to my berth in which i am very comfortable with two other warrant officers. the men and sergeants are on the troop deck and none too comfortable but are jogging along alright now.\\n\\nthe first part of the voyage the sea was very quiet, we passed gibraltar in a fog at night, so couldn’t see it. we then skirted the coast of algeria and had a pleasant run to malta where we stopped a full day. the higher officials went ashore for a few hours (including myself) and had a good time. i cannot mention troops or ships so refrain from doing so but there was a hell of a lot.\\n\\nour next stop was alexandria for three days, where we had another look round including a route march for the battalion. the sea is fairly rough at this end, rather surprising, but a lovely colour, light blue at day and dark at night. all lights out at 8.00, perfect darkness, there is no twilight to speak of, being dark at 7.30pm.\\n\\nwe then wondered where we were off to but eventually reached port said, stopped a day, went ashore, and off we go to the dardanelles which we expect to reach tonight.\\n\\nour kits have been left behind in egypt and all we have got we stand in. we are now passing through the aegean sea, full of rocky islands, very much like the highlands of scotland. bullen has just lost his helmet over the side, but is otherwise well…\\n\\ni am in the best of health at present and hope to go through alright. i expect you heard i got married a week before i left, a lot of us did the same thing, it was quite a common occurrence.\\n\\nour old boat is a captured german liner and is full up but we have got a greek crew with a few portuguese thrown in and so are a mixed lot, especially with welsh men aboard. how are things going at the office, i have been away nearly a year… i shall be glad to hear from you now and again just to keep in touch… i must close now as they say a mail is being collected before we land… yours sincerely,\\n\\ngeorge dear burgie,\\n\\nthanks awfully for your letter, glad to hear that you are all serene and that the g.w.r. is still flourishing without me, as a matter of fact i expect it’s better without me but still there you are.\\n\\nby jove! i had no idea that the audit had shoved so many fellows into khaki, its fine. well the old brigade has had some pretty varied experiences in this land of stinks and bad beer.\\n\\nwe landed at havre last march and after a freezing night under canvas on the heights behind the town we had a rather weird train journey up country. there were about 10 of us per cattle truck with a few wisps of straw to sleep on. our horses were boxed six in a truck, three with their heads facing the ‘engine’ and three facing the rear of the train. two men sat on corn sacks between their bottoms. if they kept the shutters closed they had a beautiful journey as it was so warm with the horses…\\n\\nat about 2am the old caboodle pulled up and we thought we were in for a dreary hang about, however the order came down to bring out the dixies… and fall in for something hot. i took our one up and the liquid smelt so good that with a little judicious wangling we managed to get another one full. when we tasted it, it was simply gorgeous. boiling hot coffee and rum as only frenchmen can make it, you know how. gee but it did go down a treat.\\n\\nwell after many jolts and bumps we arrived at our destination. it was miles from the firing line and a fearful hole at that. at nine next morning we were off again and went up further still, riding about 23 miles before we came to anchor at a rather dirty mining village…\\n\\nafter about three weeks in this show we shunted up and got our baptism. it’s a funny sensation being under fire for the first time but it soon wears off. one gets a rather nasty jolt when the first casualty occurs especially as it was in our case the finest fellow we had on the staff. he got a chunk of shell in the back of his neck and was killed on the spot.\\n\\nwe were in action at this place for about two months and took part in several bombardments, one of them being the one in which poor old joey was killed. we had some pretty rough times but were very fortunate as regards casualties. two month’s action and 2½ days’ rest, it doesn’t seem much but that’s what we got, and then at it again in a different part.\\n\\nthis show had been occupied by the germs and then by the french from whom we took over. the filth and stench was too awful for words, one of our batteries striking rather unlucky in coming across germs buried just under the surface when they started digging their guns in. the air was blue for miles…\\n\\nthe next action we had was a hell of a show. the staff were put into a huge chateau which was under observation and fire from three sides. and they didn’t half sling the lead about too. it’s marvellous that we didn’t get lifted skywards heaps of times, but still here we are. after a good spell in this show we came to rest again about 10 days or so ago.\\n\\nwe are having a good time here in the way of concerts, sports, boxing tournaments etc. the latter was great especially the bout between a farrier sergeant and a cook’s mate. they biffed at one another until neither could stand, it was awfully funny.\\n\\nlittle seedy ellis has got a snip job at a base. he came up today with a draught of men. he is having the time of his life and looks it by the dark circles under his eyes…\\n\\ni am feeling wonderfully fit and well and would not have missed coming out for quids. i suppose you saw in the paper that two of our boys have got the distinguished conduct medal. they were in major lord gorell’s battery; he is awfully bucked about it.\\n\\nwell old man i must dry up. i hope you can read this disgusting scrawl, but will make that whiskered excuse ‘active service conditions’. please remember me to all the boys and tell long liz that i would give anything for a barrel or two of the club bitter.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\ndick james dear mr rogers,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know i am still alive and have up to now succeeded in dodging those small pieces of lead which have been so frequently flying about the peninsular [dardanelles]. i expect you are wondering how i got here, also why con. [convalescent] camp. i will try and tell you briefly what happened since our leaving egypt. we left alexandria 13th august and landed at the new landing at sulva bay on the 18th under shell fire. not a very nice kick off. our first engagement was on the 21st when we took part in the big fight for hill 70 and 971. i expect you read about it in the papers, for i see the daily sketch had a page full of it. they spoke of us as the irresistable yeomanry; very glowing words of our charge also. it was a very stiff go and we were fighting from 3pm the 21st until dark on the 22nd and never stopped advancing and retiring the whole time. we had the hill on the night of the 21st but could not hold it, because no support was sent up, so the yeomanry (those of us who were left) had to retire at night after charging and capturing three lines of turkish trenches. our brigade (berkshire, buckinghamshire and dorset yeomanry) was ordered to do the charging for the division and i think we did fairly well from what the general said in his report. of course we suffered pretty heavy. after five days on the peninsular we did not have an officer left in our regiment, and only barely half the men. i have seen a few of our officers in the casualty list, but no men. i was very pleased to get the grw magazine while resting in dugouts on chocolate hill. i hope no more of the audit boys have fallen since the last i saw. i suppose you are still pretty slack in the office. i find i’ve run away from the tale, but here in the y.m.c.a. tent it is so crowded and the piano on the go, it is rather difficult to write. after resting from the big fight three days we went into the trenches for spells of five days, on one case seven days. after five weeks i caught dysentery and had to come away. i was put on a hospital ship and brought to st. patrick’s hospital, malta. during those five weeks i was pretty lucky. the only close bullet was one through my right sleeve and grazing my arm. we all have some very narrow shaves from shrapnel. i had the sandbags of my dugout knocked down one day, but fortunately i was down to get water. probably, if i had been inside i would have caught it properly. i expect to be here about a fortnight to three weeks before i go back. i am hoping the boys will be across before that, and the turkish army cut in two.\\n\\ni suppose the office still looks more empty than it ever did. how is mr jackson getting on in france? i see his regiment has been in action. i have often wondered how he would get on in trench warfare. i suppose mcconnel is still going strong. will not stop for more now as i shall lose the mail. kind regards to mr cox and all the men on the section. hope you are still enjoying the best of health and still dodging the bombs. hope to write again soon. yours truly,\\n\\ne.j. cowles. dear effie,\\n\\nyou were doubtless surprised to get a postcard from up here, don’t know why they sent us such a long way north, it is alright but i think london would have suited me better, could have seen my pals sometimes. i am not allowed to get out of bed yet, tried the other night and fell down in a fit serves me right for disobeying orders. i have the piece of shell which fractured my skull and shall look after it for a souvenir. the doctors say i was very lucky not to have been put right out. it was a heavy piece (british) would not have been wounded by anything less. we were in an advanced post sticking beyond our front line called the “duck’s bill” and naturally pretty close to the german trenches. in fact they surrounded us… [lines censored]\\n\\ni hear from bedford that the company has been told to prepare for the dardanelles. i don’t know where he is though, have heard nothing from him. we are having a concert with our ward this afternoon and we have plenty of visitors in every afternoon, some very fair women taking them generally, and very decent too, treat everybody alike. remember me kindly to mrs lewis. i shall make a more determined attempt to see you if i get a sick leave which is most probable. well, have no more news at present. how about taking up a post in your department when this lot is over, it would suit me to have headquarters in london for a time, mustn’t count chickens though. goodbye old boy,\\n\\nregards,\\n\\nbilly dear mr hunt,\\n\\nthanks for the cigarettes and magazine, all very much appreciated and i want to confess something. i am terribly short of cigarettes just now. don’t know how to get on.\\n\\nso you had peter jackson up to see you a short time ago. lord, how i wish i could get up to london. some of our chaps have leave but this advance seems to have put a stop to it. that’s the only reason i am sorry for the long awaited advance. god knows it was really time we did do something if only to relieve the pressure on eastern front. we are in this part of the line and are still sitting tight worse luck. i wish they would get a move on here as well. it has cost us a good many casualties, but i think the germans, what with the bombardment they got and the counter attacks they delivered must have lost many more than us.\\n\\ni have got an interesting souvenir. it is part of the framework of a german aeroplane, the fourth which our airmen have recently brought down in this neighbourhood. the machine gun in one of our planes had killed the german pilot and the machine getting out of control exploded, or at least the engine did, and the whole aircraft crashed to earth. god, it was an awful mess. both the pilot and observer were killed, the former being bashed out recognition, but the latter survived the fall but died shortly afterwards. our airmen seem to be the masters of the germans now, although the taubes seem to be the faster machines, our men seem to have much spirit and initiative.\\n\\nabout a fortnight ago i saw a fleet of fourteen of our planes cross over our lines on a raiding expedition. they were in close formation, and the germans sent up a rain of shells without doing any damage. the raid was very successful, i believe, two transport trains full of german reinforcements being wrecked, a large station destroyed.\\n\\nwell that’s about all from me, let me hear from you soon. how is everybody up there? best regards to all the section,\\n\\nyours very sincerely, gilbert williams dear dada,\\n\\nmany thanks for the slough paper and magazines. was very sorry to see that jefferies and how have lost their lives. i heard from arthur this morning and he tells me that fred blane has died of wounds in the dardanelles. i expect you remember him in the “windsor operatic society”. [line censored]…\\n\\nharold white (ginger) who lived with arthur has joined the royal artillery garrison and is now at plymouth. arthur has sold the motorbike. petrol is too expensive he says. since i wrote last i have been moved to a little village about 2½ miles out of the town i was in then. it is a dead and alive hole with only a few houses and two cafes, only one of which is open. the other has had all the windows blown out.\\n\\nwe expect to move further on still in a day or two. we have changed our truck for a much larger one and have made ourselves very comfortable. it is about 30 feet long, so we have divided it off (with our ground sheets for curtains) at one end to make a bedroom, and the rest of the truck we have fitted up with desks and cupboards. i spent the other evening making a table out of bacon boxes etc. at present we are living very well indeed, with bacon and kidneys for breakfast, steaks and vegetables for dinner, jam and honey etc. for tea and bread and cheese and pickles for supper. not bad for “active service”. the post office cook still does all our cooking. there are four of us on the staff here now. one attached to each of the three divisions, and one learning the work who will probably leave soon to take charge of a division. there have been plenty of aeroplanes over here lately. a german came over the other evening and our people shelled it for about half an hour. i don’t know whether it was brought down or not. i had a nice long letter from mr hunt yesterday. he sent me photo of the “roll of honour” and told me all the latest audit office news. well, i don’t think i have much more to tell you at present so will conclude with love to all,\\n\\nyours, affectionately,\\n\\nmont. dear bert,\\n\\nmany thanks for your letter received a few days ago, also for the good old woodbines which i got today. while i think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly magazine for august ’15, will you send me a copy, as i have not seen it.\\n\\nwell, we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for. the huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with jack johnson* shells, shrapnel, whizz bangs* (terrible things) and trench mortars, blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up. the general officer commanding has complimented us on our behaviour. we are now resting at a place called vlamertinghe, just south of ypres and a couple miles north of poperinghe [poperinge] in belgium. we deserve a rest for we have spent thirty-nine days in dugouts and the trenches (except three days) and needless to tell you we are very crummy, which tends to spoil the rest we are having. i never thought i was going to another phase of them after south africa. i was in poperinghe (where i met jackson a few weeks ago)…\\n\\nthe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink, and also have one with him. i suppose shall have to wait for my increase, being an absentee from the office, anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for i shall then be able to pay more income tax. i enclose a few postcards. they are showing in each card before and after, or during and after the bombardment of ypres, so you can guess what the place looks like. well bert in conclusion i must tell you that one of our sergeants who is on leave, posted this in london for me, that’s why i am able to give you a few details. kind regards to all friends in the audit,\\n\\nyour sincere friend,\\n\\njack symons. dear mr jones\\n\\njust a line to let you know that i’m still alive and am moving to king’s lynn on wednesday next. will write you later. how do you like the photo? best regards to the office. from,\\n\\nh. giles dear father,\\n\\ni do hope you and mother have not been worrying much about me as i am getting on all right. my wound is well now and the broken bone is my only trouble-  the two ends took the wrong turning first time so a couple of days ago they put them on the right road again. i ought not to be left with a short leg as there is about 40lb weight on the end of it, in fact i should not be surprised if it finishes off ahead of the other. one good thing is i get very little pain except when i am moved.\\n\\ndid you get my postcard? i haven’t had an answer yet but expect letters take a long while. i believe i asked you to send me some fruit but as things take such a long while to get here i am afraid it would be bad, besides they take french money here, and as i drew £5 from the field cashier only a few days before i was wounded i am quite well off and the orderly will buy fruit for me in the town.\\n\\ni expect you are surprised to get a letter when i said on the post card that i should only be allowed to write once from this hospital, but a fresh order has come out and one letter a month is allowed.\\n\\nwell, i have written quite enough about myself i think. i am longing to get a letter from you and mother, it seems ages since i heard from you. have you taken a house in uxbridge yet or are you waiting until auntie and uncle move there. i do hope you are getting a little more used to the lonely house. please remember me to everybody and give my love to all relations next time you write and tell them i should like to hear from them if they would write although i shan’t be able to answer their letters. have you heard how frank is getting on, i meant to write him but put it off too long.\\n\\ni expect my kit has been sent home, hasn’t it? i am afraid your field glasses are lost as i left my equipment in the wood when i was hit. i am awfully sorry if they are but perhaps one of the men picked them up. i arrived here with only one boot and only one puttee, so will you send me a pair of puttees and a tie out of my kit. i shall be supplied with boots when i leave here, which won’t be for a while i expect. one thing i shall be very glad to get will be some books.\\n\\nwe are very well treated here, and the belgian sisters from the convent are very good and often bring us grapes or apples.\\n\\ni didn’t get a very long run for my money, did i? it is rotten being out of the show, not that i wanted the war to last long, far from it, but while it was on i liked to have a finger in the pie, but it is no good grumbling and the best thing to do is to hope it will soon be over so that i can soon be home with you both again. please give my kind regards to kate. very best, love to you both. cheer up and don’t worry about me.\\n\\nyour loving son, (2nd lieutenant mayo)\\n\\ncharlie.\\n\\np.s. i hope you can read this, it is awkward writing lying down. several months ago, when we relieved the french of these trenches it was noticed how quiet the ‘atmosphere’ was, and it seemed quite in keeping with the beautiful hilly scenery. since the british occupation however, things here have livened up considerably, and it has been found necessary to greatly strengthen the trenches, and make dugouts much deeper and safer, because of the various kinds of souvenirs sent over from the enemy.\\n\\ntheir latest was the aerial mine, of which no doubt you have read. it is exactly like an oil drum to look at, with wood ends, and explodes with a terrific report. i don’t think it can be fired from a gun, as it comes tumbling across in such an awkward manner.\\n\\ni don’t think we manufacture these articles at woolwich as we can afford decent shells! we are not troubled very much by german artillery, but they make up for that with trench mortars and rifle grenades.\\n\\nas a signaller i escape some of the hardships of trench life, especially now the winter has arrived, and much prefer duties which keep one under shelter to those of exposure at the parapet! of course we have exciting times, when any wires are cut by trench mortars etc. and which need to be repaired at once wherever the break is.\\n\\njust lately i am having a lot of experience at making and fitting fireplaces in dugouts. we generally use biscuit tins to hold the fire and rummage among old houses in the village nearby for pieces of piping to take the smoke out, usually through the entrance as it is impossible to cut a hole through the roof on account of the sheet of iron. fuel for burning is generally a problem but a small supply of coke is allowed and we add to it all kinds of wood etc. when sitting up at night it is surprising what good time we keep when waking up the next fellow to carry on, if there is no fire, but if a good fire is on, we get quite generous, and don’t mind allowing the next man an extra hour or so to sleep!\\n\\nwe have had several days of rain this week, which doesn’t tend to improve life in the trenches, or out. on our journey to billets last saturday night, we took a road through a wood constructed by the royal engineers. it wasn’t quite finished, and in places was ankle deep in water, so our march was more of a paddle. parts of this wood, which is in a valley had been purposely flooded, so the road had to be laid on faggots and will be a piece of work when finished.\\n\\nwe are fortunate in having dry billets, with beds raised above the floor and a small fire. sheep skin coats have been issued to us, and are very warm. there is a fellow here now imitating a monkey and holding out a small cup to an audience seated on the beds, while another chap is playing an accordion! all we need now are top boots (tall rubber waders or gum boots designed to try and avoid the problem of trench foot) to paddle through the trenches! there is plenty of water about but very little to drink or wash in. it is a fine place for people who are good at finding excuses for not washing! but there are very good hot water baths here, only it isn’t any good having a bath unless one really needs it, on account of the colour of the water!!\\n\\nwe do very well though, for food and clothing both of which are good, and well supplied, and considering the many distant places it is sent from, it speaks well of the splendid way our navy is doing ‘its bit’… dear arthur,\\n\\ni really must make this effort to write to you and let you know how i am progressing. well so far as a little internal trouble i’m keeping fairly fit now that the cold weather has started, and on my present job i can doctor myself, i am prepared to stick this campaign until further orders.\\n\\nwe are now in our winter quarters and a very nice place it is. right on the edge of the cliffs, with a beautiful sea below, it reminds me very much of cornwall. then just across is the island of imbros, and the sunlight on those mountains is sometimes marvellous. on a quiet, warm day, with the birds singing, one wonders if there is a war on, but the blooming shells soon drive that idea away. it’s jolly cold now though, but we have been served out with nice thick underclothes, and waterproofs, and top boots and except for always living in the ground, our comforts have been looked after as far as possible. our food is as good as anyone could want, also i’m now used to a lot that before i’d turn my nose up at, and so long as the ships can land the goods i don’t think we shall be so badly off.\\n\\nmind it does blow, and the sea gets awfully rough and then no ships can come near us. we have the sea on three sides and the turks on the fourth, so we are truly between the devil and the deep sea. the turks still find some ammunition from somewhere whether our guns and the warships knock the very dickens out of them. it’s very exciting to watch a battle especially now it’s on our side the guns are not like at antwerp where we were the ones potted. now i am too sleepy to continue and as the firing has quieted down i’m going to sleep and continue tomorrow.\\n\\n5/12/15. i’ve not had a chance to finish this letter before, so here goes. we’ve had snow and rain and thunder and such lightening, and lord it has been cold, everything frozen and even the water in my water bottle. but today has been beautifully mild and calm, almost like summer again. i have just received a packet of letters from my wife, written at different times since may, so am still in hopes that there may be some more back dates knocking around the world for me. we had three men killed last night in a little spasm, and today our guns and the turks have been flinging dirt at each other. we used to duck once upon a time, as the shells came over, but now everyone seems curious to see what sort of a burst it will be and how much dust is knocked up, and heaps have cameras taking photos.\\n\\nenclosed is a bit of heather which grows in great profusion all over the peninsular. and the troops use in the trenches to boil their dixies on. and now about the office. do you know but, it’s quite an effort to remember the routine now…\\n\\ni suppose mr millow is still with you and is there any chance of h.r.h. goff joining say as a s.c. (probably senior clerk)? there is now a singing in the air and bang just as i write they’ve dropped one over to us. sometimes a shell bursts, and when we are working at something we don’t even know it’s come along. it’s funny what you can get used. but to get back to the office. i expect you have heaps of ladies there now, lord i haven’t seen a woman since april. what do they look like? i expect they scent out the office, and how careful you all must be not to swear. we often laugh here at the thought that if ever we do return to civil life again, we’ll be digging a little hole in the garden to live in and stirring up our tea with a bit of stick or our finger and just spit on the floor when smoking and if a little tickling in our shirt, just hopping it off in the street.\\n\\ni am out of paper (he is writing this on envelope), but it don’t matter. how are the lambs going? here’s one that’s doing a little doing a little bleat far from home. i’d like to come you know, and have a rub at a bed and a roof, also a drop of beer perchance. living in a hole for seven months now and the blue sky above gets a bit monotonous at times especially when the dirt will persist in falling on your face when you are trying to sleep and when it rains you’re up to your knees in no time, and that’s always at night. we had rum served out tonight and do you know, i can’t bear the stuff, just pause and think by the wayside, i can’t drink rum, in fact i hate it. how we do change by time. now how is everyone down the club? remember me to emmie and mrs fellows and may. i understand that mr welsh and mr davies have been awfully kind to my wife, and i reckon its jolly good of them. this war seems to have found me so many kind friends, i don’t know what i’ll do to repay them all if i live through this…\\n\\nwhat has become of beaumont and jackson, and is my pal jimmy edwards still alive,… bert i’d like to send you a turkish shell but the post office won’t accept them for transit, anyhow perhaps i’ll bring home a nose fuse for a paper weight. do you know back in the summer i had a shell drop just off the seat of my trousers and it did not explode. kaw! it was a bit of luck, i didn’t stop to pick him up though, in case he changed his mind later. well now i’ve tried to remember everyone, but do you give heartiest good wishes to the office for a merry xmas and a victorious new year and trusting you’ll all be safe from zeppelins. yours very sincerely,\\n\\nt. harold watts the last time i wrote i think i told you we had lost our comfortable job on\\nrailheads. we have been shifted from general headquarters and are at\\nthe most godforsaken hole there can possibly be in france. we had a\\nrotten journey raining all the time. reveille* was at 4am and we\\neventually left the station about 10am. the accommodation consisted of\\nthe old cattle trucks, and rations of bully and biscuits. it was a very cold\\nand uncomfortable journey.\\nwe arrived at our destination about 4.30pm and after standing in the rain\\nfor 2½ hours with full pack on, we set out on a ten mile march. it’s the\\nworst march i’ve ever done. the majority of us at the finish were\\nabsolutely knocked up and were only too glad to crawl into the billets\\nbefore going to bed, which was about 12pm. they gave us a mug of tea\\n(the first we had since six in the morning) and best of all a ration of rum.\\nthe up to date soldier kit to carry about from place to place consists of\\n150 rounds of ammunition, inside the pack; overcoat, fur coat, two pairs\\nsocks, one pants, one shirt, ground sheet, iron rations [emergency food\\nsupply]. outside pack; mackintosh and mess tin, in haversack; cleaning\\nkit, hold all, 24lbs rations, soap and towel, and on top of that extras such\\nas handkerchiefs, plate, mug, tobacco, etc, two smoke helmets* in a\\nsatchel slung over the shoulder, a respirator in the left flap of a tunic and\\nfield dressing on the right, and of course the rifle, in all it’s no light weight\\non a long march, it takes all one’s strength and staying power to keep\\ngoing.\\nwe are billeted in a barn and have a sea of mud to get through. we have\\nno boards, so sleep on the ground, fires are not allowed in the billet and\\nat night time it’s devilish cold.\\nin the village there is a little general shop (now nearly sold out), one pub\\nwhere they sell something they charge 2½d for and call beer, there are\\nno shops of any description and of course no amusements.\\nrations are not so good now (today’s dinner, sunday, bully beef, stew\\nand two potatoes between 35 men. we have a loaf and a bit (small loaf)\\nand two tins of jam between seven men, the short bread issue being\\naugmented by the world famous army biscuits.\\nour captain is a perfect gentleman and about the most popular man in\\nthe regiment, the junior captain (an absolute sport) and the platoon\\nofficers are all very decent sort of fellows. we appear to be much better\\noff in this respect than before, and certainly think that d. co. has got as\\ngood a selection of officers as any other company in the battalion. one of\\nour fellows ran across a number of audit r.e.s and they enquired after\\nmaggs and myself.\\nfreddy or\\nwhat’s left of him after some very stiff marching. dear mr hunt,\\ni expect you have heard at the office about me being in england suffering\\nfrom gas poisoning, and as it is quite a long time since i last wrote to\\nyou, no doubt a few lines will be acceptable, to explain matters.\\nwe left the trenches at vimy ridge on july 5th, and marching back about\\n14 miles we eventually reached a village named ostreville for the purpose\\nof having a divisional rest. the signallers thought an orchard would be\\nvery convenient to erect bivouacs in, so when we were busy carrying out\\nthis idea an old frenchman appeared at the scene, and raised objections.\\nhowever he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of the orchard,\\nthinking, i suppose, that we would wander about his place! we had an\\nenjoyable time here for six days, and then had to return to our old billets\\nnear mount st. eloi until the whole of the division had retired. we guessed\\nby this move that our ‘rest’ was over, and the following days were spent\\nin marching, and travelling by motor lorries and train until we arrived at\\nmericourt station on july 21st near albert.\\nafter a delightful swim in the river near the billet we marched off the\\nfollowing night, to take part in the ‘big push.’ we slept in an open field\\nthat night near fricourt farm, and were rather rudely awakened by a few\\ngerman shells landing near us.\\nfor five days we were lying in reserve in this district, and occupied our\\ntime in watching an army of men at work in the valley, making roads,\\nrailways, boring for water and laying down water pipes, also practicing\\nattacks in the old trenches. it was very interesting to see the great\\namount of artillery, busy practically all day and night, and to read their\\nmessages sent by visual signalling [often using lights] from a ridge across\\nthe valley.\\nour period in reserve being up, we moved to mametz wood to lie there in\\nsupport for five days, before going into the trenches at high wood. on\\narrival at the edge of the wood at night, we were welcomed by a big dose\\nof gas shells and shrapnel, which was applied steadily throughout the\\nnight by the german artillery. having to assist in putting our signalling\\ngear into a hole for safety, i was prevented from using my respirator for\\nthe first quarter of an hour, as we could not see on account of the\\ndarkness and dust made by the ammunition columns rushing along the\\nroad, and it was during this time that i must have breathed in enough gas\\nto put me out of action. afterwards of course respirators were used, when\\nwe were settled in holes by the roadside for the night.\\ni remained with the battalion until i was sent to the casualty clearing\\nstation on august 3rd and reached rouen hospital the next day. i had to\\nwait until the 9th and crossed the channel from havre to southampton on\\nthe new zealand ship marama, with about 800 other patients, the day\\nafter. it was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying wounded\\nmen, and the sisters and orderlies were colonials.\\nit was last friday week when i arrived here, and must say it is very\\ncomfortable and quiet. i had to remain in bed until last saturday, but of\\ncourse i cannot do any route marching yet! so i have to take life quietly,\\nwhich is no hardship i can assure you after france. i am on an ordinary\\ndiet, and taking medicine.\\ni hear you have mr symons back again, is that so? and is he back in the\\nsame old spot? i hope he is pretty fit, although i suppose there must be\\nsomething wrong with him, to be back again.\\ni suppose things are as quiet as usual with you. have you had your\\nholidays yet? this is about your time i believe. i shall be glad of a few\\nlines when you have time, to hear the latest about the office. i hope you\\nare keeping fit, also mr j.b. taylor and mr woodhams and with kind\\nregards to you all. yours sincerely,\\nfrosty.\\np.s. it is a treat to write a letter without the censor’s shadow over one! dear mr hunt,\\nthanks very much for your letter which i received a week or two ago, also\\nfor the magazine.\\nwe are in the trenches just now. in fact we seem to spend about three\\ntimes as much time in as we do out. also we are in a pretty warm spot, it\\nwas about here, towards the end of last summer that the french and\\ngerman had some of the fiercest fighting of the war. the country around\\nabout is a veritable maze of trenches. the fighting at one time was so\\nfierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the\\ntrenches, and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly\\nseeing the bones of men’s legs or their boots, or skulls sticking out from\\nthe sides of the trenches, pleasant, eh? there will be a pleasant smell\\nhere in the summer. i only hope we are not here then. in places we are\\nonly about twenty yards away from fritz and company. consequently all\\ntimes the air is pretty thick with bombs, grenades and trench mortars.\\nthese last are pretty hellish sort of toys. they have an explosion like\\nabout ten earthquakes rolled into one. but even these are not the worst\\nwe have to put up with. the trenches being so close together there is of\\ncourse any amount of mining going on. so one never knows when the\\nparticular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through\\nthe solar regions. when a mine does go up, there is some excitement\\nknocking about i can tell you. suppose for instance we were going to\\nexplode one, all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot\\nand directly the mine is exploded, there is hell let loose on the crater. of\\ncourse as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies, so that the air is\\nfairly full of everything that kills quickly. one can on these occasions\\nalways rely on a good many casualties. since we have been in this spasm\\nthere have been five exploded in this neighbourhood, while others are\\nexpected to go up at any time. so much for conditions here.\\nhow is everything in town? pretty quiet i suppose. i see you’ve had the\\nzepps (zeppelins) over again? is it a fact that one dropped in the\\nthames? (lines censored.) that is about all the news, so will close,\\nkindest regards to everybody. yours very sincerely,\\ngilbert williams. dear mr smith,\\ni hope you will accept my apology for not writing before. it has not been\\nwant of will it has been lack of opportunity. i wonder how you all are. i\\nam fairly well now but was very queer for several weeks recently. i also\\noften wonder how you are all getting on and should like to hear.\\na matter of about five minutes ago fritz was bombing us, and i have just\\ngot up off the ground where i was laying for about twenty minutes. one\\nfellow has been hit, but not severely by shrapnel. this is his second visit\\nthis evening.\\nit will soon be twelve months since i left you. it seems a very long time\\nago. i am afraid i have very little i may tell you, so will conclude by\\nasking you to accept my best wishes for the new year and desiring that\\nyou will remember me kindly to any enquiring friends. believe me, dear\\nmr smith, sincerely yours,\\nw. wiggs sunday\\ndear charlie,\\nhow are things going with you now? i expect like the rest of us will be\\nglad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it, it has\\nbeen rough lately.\\nsince i last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it\\nis a warm shop, for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is\\nnothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it\\ngives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work. you see of\\na night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is why they do\\nnot fire a lot then.\\njust on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost, oh what a\\nrough time the poor devils had, snow and mud as much as you like and\\nthey had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got to them. i\\nexpect there have been a few more from paddington called up by now, it\\nseems if the authorities mean to have all the men they want and if they\\ncan’t get them one way they will another, and it certainly looks as if they\\nwill be wanted for out here. one cannot see any signs of an early\\nsettlement. i see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in\\nengland again. i suppose you have not seen anything of them yet, has\\nrory moore had any more frights? we have the taubes [german aircraft]\\nover our hospital nearly every day or night and i can tell you we got some\\nstarts at times. the nearest we have to them since i have been here is\\njust one yard from the main door, at 12.30 it blew in two pairs of double\\ndoors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal of\\ndamage to life which after all is the main thing. the arrangements we in\\nwork is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky.\\nof course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack\\nand we get a warm time and i should like to enlarge on these things but\\nof course you understand i cannot.\\ngive my kind regards to all and trusting you are well.\\nyours will dear mr w.h. davies,\\n\\njust a line to let you know i have not forgotten you. i received a letter on\\ntuesday 3rd of january 1917 which you sent to me on august 24th 1916.\\nby the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments\\nand officers, but it has arrived quite safe at last. i received the letter you\\nwrote in october quite safe. i am sorry i have not written before but we\\nwere rather busy when i received your last letter and we could not send\\nmore than a field card for about a month. well i am pleased to tell you\\nthat i am still going on first rate. i expect you will be surprised to hear\\nthat i have left the northamptonshire regiment and am now attached to\\nthe army printing and stationary services. we are opening a new branch\\nin the photography line and i am here as a photographer.\\ni am unable to tell you more than this up to the present. i expect harry\\nwill be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in\\nthis respect.\\nthere are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms\\nare not finished yet we are having an easy time. the officer is away in\\nengland just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are\\non our own and i am in charge.\\nwe are billeted with a company of australian electricians, mechanics,\\nmining and boring engineers and are having a fine time. there are a good\\nlot of fellows and make us very welcome. we had a grand xmas with\\nthem and they know how to enjoy themselves. you can understand what\\na change this is after being in the line. just before i came on this job we\\nhad over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when\\nthe weather was favourable.\\nwe went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then\\nback again. the water was over our knees in the trenches and it was\\nimpossible to use the communication trenches at all. we were holding the\\nfront line with two platoons (i should say our boys’ section of the line).\\nour platoon was twenty two strong including the officer, and during the\\nbombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes. there were no\\ndugouts of any description there, so you can imagine what it was like to\\nstand there for four nights. we hoped the weather would be alright so\\nthat we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be. we were\\nout digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas\\nshells, we had two chaps hit with them and put right out.\\nthe sights and smells were awful, as a good many of the chaps lay just as\\nthey fell during the advance. it was impossible to bury them. also there\\nwere about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed\\nby shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns. our guns never\\ncease down there, as soon as one section stop, another lot open out so\\nyou can tell there is somme noise.\\nthe last time we came out, was for forty eight hours’ rest then in again\\nand over, but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent\\nin a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in\\nour division went over in our place.\\nwe were held in reserve and i am glad to say not required after all. well i\\nthink this is about all, for now, i have been with the a.p. & s.s. since\\ndecember 1st and i can tell you, i hope i shall stop here. i have no desire\\nto go back to the line. kindly remember me to all old friends. with kind\\nregards to yourself and all on section 4.\\nyours sincerely, h.a. skilling\\nno. 2 section advanced section\\narmy printing & stationary service… dear mr taylor,\\nno doubt you think that i have forgotten all about you and my friends of\\nthe audit, but never let it be said (this is an army term, if you please.)\\ntruth to tell i have been going to write time after time, but have had to\\nput it off for various reasons. i am taking this opportunity of writing to\\nyou, while i am in charge of tonight’s guard. i get this job about once a\\nweek now, it’s not so bad, i have three men and a man in waiting; we\\nmount at 5pm and dismiss at 7am. we make ourselves as comfortable as\\nwe can, in the guard tent, which just covers over the top of the sand\\nbags, and these have got grass growing out of them now. the sand bags \\nare about 4ft high and make a good protection. april 1st i got my two\\nstripes up, after being a 1st air mechanic for 12 months, the noncommissioned officers have a very decent mess here, and everything is\\nok. i am corporal in charge of wireless, photographic, electrical and all\\ninstruments used on aeroplanes, i have had a very good education on all\\nthose subjects, but the one i like best is the wireless, it’s far more\\ninteresting than photography, which is a very big thing indeed out here,\\nand a lot depends upon a good photograph of the hun lines…\\nyesterday i saw a nice little game between one of ours and one of theirs,\\nafter our anti-aircraft fire had taken it up a bit higher, our machine went\\nfor it and got well over the top of it, then two more of ours came along\\nand forced it down, she tried all manner of tricks, but down she came\\nalright, and landed a clean machine, not broken in any part, and the two\\nhuns inside it quite well.\\nwe gave a revue (theatrical show) to our chaps here on the 13th, it went\\noff alright, we started at 9pm and gave a two hours show, am enclosing\\nprogramme, and will forward a photo of myself as the ‘oldest inhabitant’\\nas soon as i receive them from the frenchman who took them…kind\\nregards to all of the section and the remainder of the agreements, and\\nhoping you are fit and well. good bye. yours sincerely,\\nf.r. morris dear charles,\\njust a line to let you know i am getting on fine. i have been in france\\nsince good friday morning. well it is not so bad, but of course not so\\ncomfortable as the office work.\\nwe had the lord mayor of london over to see us the other sunday when\\nwe were resting, he made a little speech.\\nhow are all at the office? you might remember me to mr woodhams, mr\\njones and mr cowan and the boys also the girls. i suppose mr redford\\nhas retired by now.\\nwe have been in the trenches since the 13th and i expect we shall go out\\nshortly. our little dugout has just been flooded out, a very heavy\\nthunderstorm, but we have run it out. it is rotten to see how the towns\\nhave been shelled to pieces. i don’t suppose they will ever be rebuilt.\\nmy brother was home on leave some time ago that is the second time so\\nhe has not got off badly. he has been promoted to sergeant now. he\\nseems to be getting on fine.\\nhave you seen ernie smith? how is he getting on, is he still in the a.p.c.\\n(army pay corps, non-fighting troops)? as i hear a lot have been\\ntransferred into line regiments.\\nwell here’s to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the\\nsame old place. the trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from\\nthe huns so had to keep a bit low.\\nmy address is 3343 lance corporal j. davies, no. 1 platoon d company,\\n6th city of london rifles, b.e.f., france. you might drop me a line to let\\nme know how you are getting on and any news,\\nkind

              "'dear mr welsh,\\n\\nwe were only out here a matter of a few hours before we went into the trenches; we were there for eight days and then came on to what is called a rest camp. i suppose it is called that to distinguish it from the trenches because the men are at work all day road and trench making and it comes under both rifle and artillery fire. we got here at 7 o’clock yesterday morning and were shelled at 9 o’clock.\\n\\nin the trenches it was fairly bad, they are so narrow and smelly and one is being potted at and shelled all the time. a turn of eight days was really quite long enough because it is strenuous work and even when you do turn in for a rest you have to be ready to turn out at once on an alarm.\\n\\nthe country is really quite pretty and just like the hills and valleys of south wales, but there are no brooks or rivers. it rains hard for a month each year usually about this time and then there is no more until the next rainy season. but although it is so gloriously sunny something is wrong with the place and it really isn’t as healthy as it looks. i think the flies have something to do with it as well as the heat and the still unburied dead bodies about. there are millions and millions of flies here and they are all over everything. put a cup of tea down without a cover and it is immediately covered with dead ones, they are all round your mouth and directly you open it to speak or to eat in they pop. it is a game. we have all got nets of course, we should have been worried, no medicine by now if we hadn’t.\\n\\nwe get plenty of bully beef and army biscuits, but bread and fresh meat is still a luxury and it is not possible to buy anything. it must have been a “no man’s land” because there are no houses or buildings of any kind to be seen and except the flies, the only living things are green canaries and lizards.\\n\\nwe live in dugouts built up the reverse sides of the hills. they are just holes really, but all the same they can be made very comfortable with a bit of digging and a few waterproof sheets. they are not shell proof by any means and the one i slept in during my first night here was knocked in completely by a shell pitching right into it. fortunately i was not at home at the time. we have another now and i must try and get a photo of it and let you see what it is like. i must send you one of our\\n\\nmess dugout too.\\n\\neverything here is named after the regiment responsible for the making or taking. for instance the road we made from our trenches to this camp is called “new bedford rd” and the ridge we took and now occupy is called on the army maps, bedford ridge. i have just been filling in and colouring my map and find it is one of the most, if not the most, advanced line of the lot. standing on that ridge it is possible to see what a lot of country we have taken and now hold, but there is nothing to get wildly excited about. each position is strengthened as much as possible before another attempt is made to push on and the whole thing is just steady progress. something might happen suddenly, i only hope it does.\\n\\nwe have had some very big ships out here and they have been bombarding the forts heavily now for some few days, and there are cruisers, monitors etc. standing in the bay helping the land batteries to shell the trenches. you see a flash and then wait a long time before hearing the boom and the shriek of the shell passing over our heads, almost together, then look round quickly and see the burst of the shell in or over the trenches sometimes before hearing the explosion. the first we know of shells aimed at us is the bang of the explosion, and it is too late to get out of the way. three officers were laid flat on their backs the other day without any hurt except to their dignity and farther on six men were buried without one being injured. it isn’t always like that though.\\n\\nthere is quite good bathing here when we can find time to go. as the beach is in full view of the enemy, and comes under their shell fire, it would not appeal to the nervous. we never keep closer together than ten yards when we are undressing and swimming in hopes that the turk will not consider one man worth the price of a shell. we have had some casualties through the men keeping too close together, but after washing out of a teacup for a week or more it is worth a bit of risk to get rid of some of the trench dust and smell and feel and look clean again. and really is the best bathing i’ve ever had. the water is quite warm and clear.\\n\\nall the hospital work is done on board a ship that stands in the bay. if the cases are serious or lengthy they are transferred to one of the hospital ships that calls daily and then go to either one of the bases or back to england. we land troops night or day in spite of the fact that they come under fire so it is possible for a man to be on his way back wounded, by the same ship that bought him from the base, without ever having landed.\\n\\nwe had a grand voyage out. all the officers had either staterooms or 1st class cabins and the food mostly was just the same as we should have had on an ordinary cruise to india or australia, wherever it is that the cruise line calls. the usual cabin stewards and waiters were in attendance and it was difficult to remember that we were not exactly on a pleasure trip. we did enjoy those two weeks…\\n\\nkind regards,\\n\\nyours sincerely,\\n\\nh.w. cronin, lieutenant.\\n\\ni am acting as captain until some of the others come back from hospital. dear nic (boyce),\\n\\nthanks very much for your interesting letter… i wondered when i would hear from someone at the office. also many thanks for your good wishes and congratulations on my marriage which i have conveyed to my wife. i am sure she will thank you all very much.\\n\\nwell to tell you a little about our experiences, we started off mysteriously one sunday from devonport on the captured german liner derflinger, not a bad boat. the warrant officers had 2nd class quarters it was all right. food was very fair. submarine pickets* every night for one of the four companies, lights out… at seven or half past. stole by gibraltar at night in a fog expecting it to be torpedoed. we did reach malta in due course after skirting north african coast, spent a day there, went ashore, had a few drinks which we needed being very hot and then on to alexandria for three days, ashore every night, not a bad place, of course the lower men didn’t go, except for a route march on the saturday. our movements were kept very secret and we couldn’t find out what was to be done with our division, we then pushed to port said and had a day there. all of a sudden, we received orders to sail and soon found we were off to gallipoli as we were passing through the aegean sea, which is as you know full of pretty islands. some hours before reaching lemnos, the naval guns could be heard booming and we ran into the magnificent harbour there full of shipping and life. after a day there, we pushed on to imbros 4½ miles from sulva bay during the afternoon they treated us to a naval shelling of achi baba, which is really the other side of the peninsula, but they shoot over the hills and mountains here. it was a fine sight and many of our chaps went sick at once. at night (sunday 9/8/15) our good ship made for anafarta bay where a new landing had been effected two days before. 900 rounds, four days’ rations each, as much as a man is expected to carry and they dumped us over the side in lighters [a type of flat-bottomed barge] at 7am, a short journey through the boom defences and we were ashore waiting for something to turn up.\\n\\nbivouacked on the beach and were put on unloading lighters till about 10 when the turks spotted us and started shelling, two men killed and four wounded to start with and we lost a few more, wounded during the day although naturally we took what cover we could. i had one or two near me whilst getting a timber out of the hold of a lighter but managed to dodge them all right. at night my company received orders to take picks and shovels up into the firing line which was about five miles away half way up chocolate hill… well nic the 10th were soon in the thick of it as we advanced across the salt lake in extended order.\\n\\nrifle fire now we had to dodge and many of our chaps got hit rather seriously i have since found out. i was glad of a rest at the foot of the hill but had to push on again and deliver the goods, after feeling about in the dark for some time our guide led us in single file up behind the firing line, where we laid down, bullets were whistling round but we managed to escape them… the enemy were yelling for all they were worth and i was glad when our captain ordered us down again to the beach. this took us some hours and when we reached the place, the other three had gone up to reinforce the firing line, so up we went again the next day about 6pm, nearly all things are done here in the dark as we are in view all the time. we again advanced across the take from lala baba, my heels were nearly raw through new boots and i eventually had to rest for a fortnight later on. well on our right was a hill burning furiously with many a chap caught in the flames and so perishing (not our regiment).\\n\\nwe finished on rather a feathered bed and did not find the other company ‘til next day, it was a night, we were all parched with the heat, and no water. dried up and had to dig ourselves in, it’s no light job this hiding being… like an ostrich, ‘til you make a hole large enough to get into and make yourself head cover. dear lack,\\n\\nmany thanks for the photographs received. we all think they are good and on saturday the six of us had out photo taken here in a similar position– in khaki. the two pictures together should make a lasting memento.\\n\\nwe have had little spare time since we have been training here. having been through company drill mixed with route marches, physical drill, semaphore, knot tying and frog, long jumping etc. some of our men were able to go to town on saturday… but i myself with a few others have been under orders for overseas service now waiting to proceed, so popping up town seems out of the question for us. we are numbered in alphabetical order, and in the order we are sent out. we are now fully equipped. i enclose … postage for the photographs. if you are printing any more you might save me one as i am afraid i have spoilt mine, it got bent in my overcoat pocket on saturday. please remember me to all at the office…\\n\\nn. boyce dear bert,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know i am alright, hoping you are the same… at the present time we are in dugouts. the weather is simply awful, raining day after day and especially night after night…to tell you the truth, while writing this letter i am wet through to the skin and not a dry thing for a change. we have got our winter fur coats and gum boots, but the latter cause more curses than you can imagine, for instance last night i was sent off to select dugouts for our platoon, which is number 37. it was pitch dark, no light allowed and in a strange place, well honestly i fell over at least 20 times got smothered in mud from head to feet and on the top of that wet though for it rained in torrents. on a round of inspection this morning to see if all were ‘comfortable’ i was ‘blinded’ up hill and down dale, ‘sergeant this’ and ‘sergeant that’.\\n\\nhow can you expect men to live in this, and then to put a dampener on the lot, was the language from the occupiers who unfortunately were in a residence that fell in during the night. they took shelter under a tree from 2am after looking for me for half an hour or so, but they could not find me, for the only thing that would shift me, after settling down, if i may call it that, would be a ‘jack johnson’ and then i would have no option.\\n\\nwhile in the trenches last week john and i were up to our knees in water and got our gum boots half full. the line is a bit quiet lately and only now and again do we get a shelling, but one gets used to it. that, to give you an idea, is like sitting at paddington and hearing the engines screech.\\n\\nafter our stretch this time i shall be looking forward for a short leave for i have been here nearly three months now and we stand a good chance. well i must now conclude…yours sincerely\\n\\njack symons\\n\\np.s. every other home down near the rest camp is an estaminet (small french café) where they sell what they call ‘beer’, and as much as i like a drop of good beer i have given the stuff out here ‘best’ for is awful muc. dear mr hunt,\\n\\nplease accept yourself and convey to the other gentlemen my best thanks for the state express cigarettes. they are fine. oh what a picnic it is in the trenches just now. we have been in the trenches 10 days up to now, and except for the last two days it has been raining almost steadily. the result is mud, mud and yet more mud, knee deep in places. but luckily we have long top boots from trench wear, so that the mud does not worry as much, except that is making our feet as cold as ice… we have been issued with fur jackets so we can keep our bodies warm.\\n\\njust now the whole countryside is covered with snow and moving objects are distinguishable a long distance off. for instance this morning when i was on duty with the gun i could see the germans walking down a road away behind their lines. i had several bursts at them with the gun but they were out of range. made me damned mad i can tell you seeing the blighters and then not being able to lay them out.\\n\\nyou can’t realise the power one seems to possess when handling a maxim. personally i feel as if i could lay out the whole german army. we fire about a couple of thousand rounds every night into fritz’s trenches just to keep them quiet. they (the germans) have been trying to find the gun, both with their maxims and with shells, but up to now, they’ve not succeed. kind regards to everybody. yours very sincerely,\\n\\ngilbert williams. i might say we are all merry and bright and not down hearted yet.\\n\\ndear mr hunt,\\n\\nreceived card alright for which i must thank you very much. we are still at longmoor and no signs of moving as i have been made cook’s mate and had to work very hard all through xmas.\\n\\nsapper hodges as long as you kept your head down you were comparatively safe, so as it went on, this was where i had my first escape. i was on sentry duty for a couple of hours, from 1am to 3am and was instructed to keep a sharp look out. i did not care for the idea of keeping my head above the trench and looking for beastly germans, however it had to be done, it was quite uncanny to watch the enemy trench which appeared somewhat like a black wave and only sixty yards in front, then you would suddenly see the flash of their rifles and machine guns immediately after would come the report and nasty thuds on the sandbags which you might be resting against. i fired about five shots at their flashes (the only target to aim at) then another two shells which lodged in the parapet either side of my head leaving about 2 to 3 inches between me and certain death. i thought that near enough but it turned out that it was to have something nearer than that. our casualties here amounted on the average, to about two per day killed, of course, we thought it terrible at the time at least i did.\\n\\nearly april saw us relieved by another division and we were sent a few miles back for a well-earned rest, which consisted of physical drill and a run before breakfast. the remainder of the morning being spent in platoon drill musketry drills. after dinner we put the “cap on” our rest (why so called i do not know) by having a route march for two hours. we spent a few days like this and were dispatched with all possible speed to ypres, here we went in to support the canadians and spent a most unpleasant eight days, during which time we lost several hundred men, nearly all my friends who came out in the same draft and were killed or wounded, we had to retire, the best part being that the germans did not find this out until two days after when we were more or less safely bivouacking in a very pretty wood. we stayed here for about a week; then we got to work again, digging reserve trenches just behind the front line, building up parapets which had been demolished by the enemy’s high explosive shells and such like, working all night and getting what sleep we could in the daytime. one morning we were awakened by the most awful din, it seemed as though hell had broken loose, shells were falling like summer rain. and people have often told me in the course of conversation it was raining shells and i admit i took it with a grain of salt, could not be possible i thought, but such i was surprised to find was possible and actually taking place there about 3.30am. this bombardment started and about half an hour later, i, with three others, were ordered to start reinforcing. we went up in fours, it being considered safer that way, half a mile over open ground we had to do, this being swept continually with shells, to give you a slight idea i can say the previous night, just in front of our reserve trenches was a beautifully green field, and the next morning it was as much as one could do to see any grass at all, simply one mass of craters, varying in diameter from ten to twelve paces.\\n\\ni had gone about half the required distance when a shell fell only a yard from where i was, the force of the concussion [explosion] pitched me several yards to my left and i came down rather heavily, however i reached the first line without any further mishap, where we had to stay until midnight when we had to be relieved again owing to not having enough me to hold the trench. our honours were one v.c. (victoria cross), two d.s.o.  (distinguished service orders), one military cross and one or two d.c.m. (distinguished conduct medals).\\n\\nthe next day i paraded sick, my back paining me so much that i could not stand straight for a week after. i am now back with the regiment who are on the line of communications. we are having leave shortly and if possible will pay a visit to the audit office. have you any news of chichester?\\n\\nyours truly,\\n\\n(rifleman) e.h.c. stewart this trench of ours is a model in its own way, being fairly safe, and connected by good communication trenches. the commanding officer’s house of white sandbags is fitted with window, curtains, and window box with pansies in it. it is furnished with table and chairs also a large mirror. of course this is quite a ‘one occasion’ affair and don’t imagine we are here town planning with model dwellings etc! but it will show you how soldiers can adapt themselves to circumstances. at the back of our trench is ripening corn and plenty of wildflowers in bloom.\\n\\nwe have also canaries in cages in the trench! but these are used by the miners for testing the air in the mines after the explosion, to see if it was possible to finish off their job. [censored line] captured from the germans a short time ago and during the stay we were kept busy with sandbags etc. and at night of course had to especially watch the enemy.\\n\\nwhen in the reserve or support trenches fatigue work has to be done every night, such as carrying food, ammunition, material for the engineers etc. to the firing line, so you can guess it is nothing but continual ‘bob’ work (odd jobs). dear mr hunt\\n\\nmany thanks for your welcome letter volunteering so much interesting news of friends at the office. i wrote to standew just before receiving your letter, but no doubt a few more lines will be acceptable.\\n\\nbeaumont seems to be doing the best of us all. i saw williams and hull about three weeks ago in a small town near here. of course the seaforths and argylls (regiments) always move about together, but we don’t meet very often. i am glad to hear the old section is still in being, and not like the german empire is fast becoming a thing of the past! and hope your three survivors will be allowed to keep the flag flying until the wanderers return.\\n\\ni have been in the firing line several times, and at four different places, besides being in the support trenches at others. i hear this is called a mobile division which accounts for our gipsy life in france.\\n\\nour last turn in the firing line, for six days and six in the reserve was the most exciting of all.\\n\\nit has been a quiet place for two months, until two days after our occupation, when the british exploded mines under some workings of the germans near their trenches, to prevent them blowing our trench up. well! that woke them up and the following saturday they retaliated by opening rapid fire early in the morning.\\n\\nhowever we were ready for them and quickly replied, so they then bombarded us, which to say the least of it was a noisy business. that eventually ceased and rapid firing was quickly in process again, followed by another shelling, which our guns again put a stop to. the whole affair lasted an hour and ten minutes, and although we believe an attack was intended, the germans didn’t leave their trench, opposite to us. after putting our trench in order again which took some time, as the parapet was blown down for about three yards near me, and a shell burst amongst a lot of beef tins, scattering them and the contents in all directions, besides the bottom of the trench being littered with hundreds of empty cartridges, we proceeded with boiling water for tea, also to show the huns by the smoke that we were still there. only a hundred yards separated the two trenches, so it was always a case of “bob down” and the enemy were good shots, as we found out to our cost when they smashed the top glasses in two periscopes within half an hour one morning.\\n\\nat present the division is resting, and i and two friends have erected a wee bivouac under an apple tree on a farm. it is quite cosy, in fine weather, but last night it was raining hard for several hours, so we had to beat a hasty retreat to an old barn. there is plenty of fruit about here, but the water supply is very bad.\\n\\nlast sunday morning we enjoyed our first hot bath since our arrival here. an old disused brewery has been turned into baths for troops, also under clothing is washed and disinfected, and kilts ironed there. fifty tubs are provided for washing in and two large vats filled with cold water to plunge into afterwards.\\n\\ni have not got any stripes yet, but have been studying signalling lately, so expect soon to be in the signal section.\\n\\ni must close now to get this letter away, hoping mr taylor, mr woodhams, and yourself are keeping well, and with kind regards to you all.\\n\\nyours very sincerely,\\n\\n‘frosty’ dear gerald\\n\\nmany thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me. no the news was quite fresh as i do not hear from anybody in the office.\\n\\nwe have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time. we were three days in the reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment.\\n\\ni am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and i can assure you it was an experience i shall never forget. anyhow williams, kemball and myself came out quite safely.\\n\\ni have seen frost out here, of course his battalion (8th argyll & sutherland highlanders) are in the same brigade also, as a matter of fact, they were in the firing line the night we came out. i received a letter while i was in the trenches from mr slater. yes, i heard about chamberlain, jolly sad was it not, if you do hear from dick james you might pass any news on to me…\\n\\nshall be glad to hear from you. i could write more, only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches.\\n\\ni am yours sincerely, fred hull.\\n\\np.s. of course you know my address. remember me to all i know. dear burgie,\\n\\nwas very glad indeed to get your letters although, your news in regard to joe comes as a shock. it was the first i had heard of him since he arrived in france in spite of the fact his regiment being quite close. am afraid the 9th and few days following were rotten days for a good many battalions, our lot as much as any. we have been “in” since the 8th and have had a fairly trying time we were reinforced during this week, not before time as we were down to our last two hundred. can’t tell how sorry i am to hear about joe as you say he was “one of the best”. i hope you chaps have not been annoyed at my not answering your very welcome letters. i don’t pride myself much on writing good yarns though and opportunities are also hard to find. as you know i had a bit of a knock at neuve chappell but have quite got over that and am now in the best of health and spirits. i came across len phillips and peter hawes in different drafts of the london scottish while down at rouen both of them have now had some experience on the job i expect. thank mr drewe very much for making inquiries, tell him i occasionally wish heartily to be on the old job again the quiet life will do for me after this. no i did not get dick’s magazine or letter expect it went astray while i was in hospital. thank him very much for sending them will you. had a game of football about two weeks ago with r.g.a.* battery, the pitch being a serious drawback. i think it was a cabbage patch. still we managed to get a good game in and most important of all, won. the weather here has on the whole been very good just lately only getting an occasional day’s rain. last night we had a sharp thunderstorm, a new experience it had at least the effect of shutting all the other disturbances of our rest up so we did not grouse. much obliged for all the information re the other fellows. am glad most of them are getting on so well. peacock seems to have come out top dog. the job alone from other examples seems to be a paying one, leaving out the holiday in scotland. well must close my epistle. please remember me to dick, mr horsley, ransley and drewe, fox. hoping both they, and yourself are, like myself o.k. [line censored]. from yours faithfully,\\n\\ne.w. bratchell dear effie,\\n\\nvery pleased to receive your letter, like yourself i find my correspondence voluminous for me at times, especially since i have taken on the duties of platoon sergeant which takes up more time than one realises at first. we are still in the trenches and have been in action twenty four days consecutively and i don’t know long we shall keep it up. had a dirty time yesterday morning dodging damned great bombs the blighters were presenting to us without exaggeration they were eighteen inches to a two feet long and made a hole about ten feet deep and fifteen feet diameter at least we did not wait to see them burst. they can be seen descending through the air and then a scoot is made to get as far as possible round the corner, the iron and dirt seem to be falling for a minute afterwards, they are disturbing. dicky gilson has not been with us the last twenty four days, he broke his glasses and would not buy new ones (went to the doctor and all that and worked the oracle and was left behind with the transport, don’t know whether he worked the ticket properly and got a safer job farther back, should not blame him if he has, his nerves have been in a shocking state, he’d brood a lot as you know that is absolutely fatal when you have a dirty job on like this. i have not seen either frost or kemball out here, do not seem to meet anybody fresh as we are always in the same district and relieve the same crowds generally.\\n\\nour pals the french in my opinion scrap jolly well except in the isolated instances which are given undue prominence by our chaps by prejudice probably. the casualties have certainly been enormous but a lot of them are a week old and one cannot form any opinion of what is going on by the lists, and i should not be allowed to say what i thought of our doings lately. cronin is still with the 5th bedfordshires and not out yet, i think not likely to be in all probability. only wish we could repeat our swimming performance off penarth ‘specially the wednesday evening ones. have heard rumours of leave being given shortly but do not rely much on it, have been offered a commission in this battalion and i may take it up if my papers go through satisfactorily.\\n\\nkindest regards and wishes to mrs lewis,\\n\\nyour old pal,\\n\\nbilly dear mr hunt\\n\\nmany thanks for your long and interesting letter which i was very pleased to receive. i am sorry i have been unable to answer it before but i have been constantly moving about from one place to another lately, and have had no opportunity of writing letters. well i am very pleased to say i am feeling very fit and well, and quite enjoying the life. when writing to you last, i was attached to the 4th division and was stationed at a small village where we were living in tents. we were stationed there about six weeks. just over a week ago i was transferred to another place about eighty miles from the other one. i travelled by motor lorry with the supply column and it took us all day from 7.30am till about 9 o’clock in the evening to do the journey. it was a glorious trip, the scenery being very fine. almost as good as our office outing, only not quite such comfortable travelling. we put up for the night in a small village, sleeping in the lorry with some empty petrol cans for a bed. next morning i was taken to the railhead where i was stationed until yesterday being only in that place just a week. while there we were all still sleeping in tents, but i was fortunate enough to have my meals with the post office staff so have had a rest from being my own cook. yesterday afternoon, just as i was going for my tea, i was sent for and told to pack up my things and catch a train to another railhead as i had to take charge as the a.m.f.o* for three divisions there. as there is usually a man attached to each division, this was rather a large order. i only had about twenty miles or so to go, but it took from 5 o’clock till after 9pm to get there. these french trains are very rapid.\\n\\ni am now attached to the 51st (highland) division, the same division as williams, a number of his lot were here today, but he was not with them. we shall probably only be here for a few days and will then move to another village further on. i was very surprised to hear of mr pritchard’s death. i also heard that mr crossley is also dead. we are having glorious weather here at present and very hot at times. glad to hear you are having a soft time on the old section.\\n\\ni was very pleased to hear about the collection of letters and photos from the troops that you are sending round the office and will certainly send you a photo later on. i have has some taken but have not received them yet. have you heard from ferdie or gray at all? we all had our photos taken at longmoor before we came out here a group of six. unfortunately, i only had a few copies and they have all been sent away. ferdie and gray are still at the base, i believe, but arthur smith is at one of the railheads somewhere. well i don’t think i can tell you any more news at present. will write again later and send photo.\\n\\nkindest regards to all.\\n\\nyours sincerely,\\n\\nm.p. pond dear bertie,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know how i am getting on. am having the time of my life out here.\\n\\nno doubt you have seen the several letters i have written to the office during the past few months, so will not go into further details, except to say that i have been exceedingly fortunate in seeing so much of india in a short time. i shall never forget my trip through the khyber pass which has since been the scene of hard fighting, one consequence of which we were hurriedly moved from fyzabad to rawalpindi in readiness to reinforce.\\n\\nyou would scarcely credit the feeling of disappointment that exists among the few british regular regiments left in india, over not being ordered to france to take their share in the war. the same feeling also exists in the territorials… a dragoon then left a few weeks ago to replace heavy casualties among the norfolk regiment at the gulf.\\n\\nas the hot weather commenced the latter part of april, and as many british troops as possible are always sent to the hills (being almost unbearable on the plains), we are fortunate enough to go, and had a three days’ march and climb to this place 8,000 feet up. well i never in any wild stretch of imagination ever dreamed that i should be soldiering in the himalayan mountains.\\n\\nkuldana, although 8,000 feet up is on the lower himalaya, and from my bungalow, which is situated on the edge of a steep precipice, i can see lovely views which words fail to describe, a perfect mixture of devonshire, scotch and alpine scenery. although seemingly only a few miles off, the higher snow clad ranges in full view are from 100 to 150 miles away. i have about 1½ miles trek to our sergeant’s mess, through beautiful scenery, lovely wild rose bushes climbing up giant pink trees, smothering them in roses, maiden hair fern and all kinds of pretty flowers in the woods. the climate is perfect, lovely english summer weather, with delightful mountain breezes. the heat in india has not distressed me in the least, not even on long arduous marches. i am feeling splendidly fit and well, and trust i shall continue so. we have no end of gaiety; all the married families of the yorkshire regiment are living in our barracks under our charge, (as their regiments had to remain behind at pindi, and are being bitten to death almost with mosquitoes.) so we have cinderella dances about three times a week, whist drives, racquet and tennis parties and have most enjoyable times.\\n\\ni wish may and eileen could take an aeroplane trip of a few hours and get to me, it would be ripping for them. i should be glad to hear that you had called to see them on your promised visit of months ago when i was home, they would be awfully glad to see you both. do drop them a card old boy. fancy it is 10 months ago today since i left to go to camp, what a lot has transpired since then. i was in the 8th middlesex 12 months ago, and i see they have lost heavily in france, funny i should have left them, and joined the 6th east surrey and to pass them at gibraltar (where they were first) on my way to india.\\n\\non the whole i am enjoying life in india immensely; i am acting company sergeant major now, and expect to be promoted to the rank shortly. we are all ‘tommies’ now. trusting you are both fit and well. remember me to stacey. yours sincerely,\\n\\nh. beaumont dear mr wheeler\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know of my whereabouts. this is our fifth sunday at sea. we left southampton on thursday october 29th shortly before midnight and our convoy of ten huge liners each with about 1700 to 2000 territorial troops on board assembled in the english channel early next morning.\\n\\nwe were escorted by british warships as far as our first port of call- malta the french warships to port said. after staying one night there we proceeded through the suez canal. we lay off the port of suez six days waiting for another escort then on through the red sea to aden where we stayed four days waiting for our japanese escort. when it arrived it brought with it an immense convoy of over 80 huge liners transports filled with new zealand and indian troops. this in addition to a convoy of thirty five vessels that came into suez whilst we lay there. so it may truly be sung that “britannia rules the waves.”\\n\\nit has been a most delightful and interesting voyage and the weather is now so hot that hundreds of troops are compelled to sleep on deck nightly as the heat is much too great below. we landed two cases of fever at aden. fortunately it does not appear to have spread any further so far.\\n\\nwe expect to reach bombay on wednesday next, december 2nd then three or four days’ train journey to fyzabad, some distance north of lucknow. shall be very glad to get there, as five weeks on board a crowded troop ship with very little opportunity for exercise is getting rather irksome, especially, when we get no ‘daily paper’, only a little wireless war news, occasionally.\\n\\ni am glad to say that i am wonderfully fit and well. our food has been wholesome and plentiful. trusting you are well, with my best wishes for as happy a christmas as is possible under prevailing war conditions, and a prosperous new year in due course. also please convey same to messrs wood, welsh, davis and others. hoping to see you again on the termination of our successful conclusion of the war.\\n\\nbelieve me, yours faithfully,\\n\\nh. beaumont\\n\\nwill you also convey my respects to mr price please? dear arthur,\\n\\ni expect you are wondering why i have not written, but it is an awful effort to get all correspondence off, and be on active service at the same time. i can’t say that i am enjoying myself out here. it’s awfully hot, and we are eaten up by millions of flies. life in the trenches is not a picnic either we have about four or five days out of them and eight or nine in them. when we are out supposed to be resting, we have to go on working parties, digging etc., then wherever we are, we are always under shell fire, so it’s not much rest after all. the last shell we had in camp, there was four killed and seventeen wounded.\\n\\nwe have been under fire for three months now, and we should like a rest as the strain is tremendous on one’s nerves. i don’t think the troops in france get it quite as bad. then again, the only comforts we have are sent from home, as the country here is quite barren, and we cannot buy anything in shops, i would give a quid for a pint of beer down the club. our food consists of half a loaf of bread per day, bacon and tea for breakfast, bully beef and biscuits for dinner and jam for tea and cheese. lime juice is served out about four times per week, that is a drop is put into a dixie of water and a cup full served out per man, and rum is served out twice a week (sometimes) that is about four table spoonful each.\\n\\nwe live in a trench and it is a mercy it don’t rain otherwise we’d be washed away. the fighting just lately has been terrible. our shells knock the enemy all ways and the sight in the trenches that we take is awful. we wear our respirators because of the awful smell of the dead. i’ll never get the sight out of my eyes, and it will be an everlasting nightmare. if i am spared to come home, i’ll be able to tell you all about it, but i cannot possibly write as words fail me. i can’t describe things.\\n\\nwouldn’t it be nice to be at walmer again and you come down and see me again, i did enjoy that time, and also seeing billy dawson and richardson. there seem to be a lot of french troops out here, but there seems to be no relief for us. nobody loves us now churchill has gone, we are nobody’s pets. it’s the army first here, except when there is work to be done, and then the naval division have to do it. you know both my brothers have commissions in the 4th bedfordshires and are at dovercourt. my wife tells me she has sent me three boxes of stuff, i received one box, and i fear that one transport has been floundered [sunk] and another has been torpedoed, so i expect that is where my other two boxes are. it’s awfully disappointing because i do look forward so to a bit of chocolate and a few biscuits from home. we get cigarettes and baccy served out to us, but it is too hot to smoke much, so that i don’t miss that so much. i get a bath in a biscuit tin when i can, but when in the trenches i have to go all the time without a wash, so you can tell i am used to being dirty.\\n\\nhow are they all down the club, and is emmie still there, and is she better or not? is paice going to looe this year? and where are you spending your holidays? lord how i’d like a holiday, i am so tired and would give anything to get away from this continual banging.\\n\\nplease remember me to all fellows who are left in the office. mr miller and goff & hills and george williams, and all the boys generally. i can’t write to all separately, also for details of my experiences you must wait until i get back, if ever i do, of which sometimes i despair.\\n\\nthe papers tell you pretty full accounts, although they are rather anticipating events as to our advancing. now i must close old chap, and thank you very much for all your kindness. wishing you all the best\\n\\nyours very sincerely,\\n\\nharold watts. dear bertie,\\n\\nmany thanks for letters and fags both were very acceptable as you can imagine for it bucks one up to hear from old associates. i also had a letter from “tinker” taylor who told me gwen has left the great western railway company. i will write to ferdi [ferdinand] and ask frosty if you give me his address. i can imagine how lovely and empty the old room looks, fancy more flappers eh, quite a selection as you say. i will just give you an idea of our work here day by day. reveille 6.00am, stables at 6.30-7.30, breakfast till 9. then exercise ride one and lead two or three [horses] for one and a half hours, then groom them until 12.15, then we water and feed and go to dinner till 2.30 then sweep up … [letter damaged]\\n\\nbed [horses] down at 4pm then water and feed at 4.15 to 4.30 and hay up at 5pm, only we take it in turns to do that and we have stables like this. [fatty has drawn a rough sketch of the stables which house the horses].\\n\\nwe have six and seven a side which leaves us four horses each. of course, sandwiched between this is probably a visit to avonmouth docks to fetch horses or take ours to the station for we only keep them for a week at the time just to knock the mud off and feed them up so as they get their shore legs and look a bit shipshape again. we have about 10,000 a week come in of horses and mules and some of them are fair devils, so wild and timid.\\n\\ni may come and see you probably saturday if i get the weekend off…\\n\\nfatty dear ernie,\\n\\nthanks very much for your letter and kind wishes. my wounds are getting on all right and they have discovered eleven in all. it is hard not to be able to get up, but i suppose a month will soon be slip by. my people came to see me yesterday and the day before.\\n\\nyou ought to see my face. they cannot shave me because i have scraps of shell sticking in, and as i had not had a shave for about a week before i was wounded, i look a pretty picture.\\n\\nwell old chap, i am glad i am wounded to get out of that hell, and if you ever meet a chap that says he wants to go back call him a liar.\\n\\nif you could manage to come down at any time i should be delighted. i have not received any letter from dalton but perhaps will get it later. that will be the time old chap when i look into the office on my way home. we’ll manage to get a drink then.  well i must close now and i expect you will have quite enough trouble to read what i have written already. hoping to be with you all,\\n\\nyour old pal, rip. dear sir,\\n\\ni have now been out in france a fortnight. i am getting on quite well in the army. food is also good and plentiful. of course, i find the life much rougher from that which i have been used to, but it is a fine experience all the same.\\n\\nwe were at longmoor camp for a week where we were equipped and put through elementary drills. we slept in a big hut there and had a sack of straw and three blankets each. the huts, of which ours was one, were called apple pie and they are about a mile from the camp, so we had to be up about six every morning in order to march down for parade at the camp. the parade was at 7.15am. some mornings we had an hour’s drill before breakfast. it was about 11pm i should think, when we arrived at longmoor on 31st march, and consequently we went straight to our hut. no light was provided so we had to fish about for our beds in the dark. fortunately it was moonlight, and after some time a lantern was brought. we were only too glad when getting up time came the next morning. it was before six. we were marched down to the camp and were inspected by the sergeant major and after waiting some time went into breakfast. roast sausage was the chief item on the menu but to our amazement no knives and forks were supplied for us…well, the only thing was to convey the sausages to our mouths with fingers.\\n\\nthe nearest thing to a knife and fork that some had was a pair of nail scissors so these were used. personally i did not know whether to feel shocked or to laugh at the situation; it ended in the latter. we audit fellows got to one table and we had to have a good laugh before we could eat much. it was a hopeless situation to be in. don’t let this discourage anyone from coming but i warn him to bring a knife and fork with him. after the first day we were issued with kits and we treasure our knives and forks now. we came across on the mail boat hantonia from southampton to havre. … we had to sleep in huts there on the docks but the sleeping accommodation was better. we audit fellows were able to keep together till last saturday night, when pond and i were sent off to different railheads. he is at 3rd corps railhead. we had to travel in horseboxes and during night time. we travelled in this manner saturday, sunday and monday nights. french shunting is severe and we were shaken up. saturday and sunday we were about 30 in the trucks, monday 17.\\n\\nwe were fortunate enough to get out into every town at which we stopped during the day. on tuesday night another young fellow and i were stranded at a station somewhere in france, and we were instructed by the military authorities to sleep in the goods shed. we had to sleep on the deck of the shed and shunting was going on during the night. this was about the limit, i thought.\\n\\ni arrived finally at my destination about midday last wednesday. now i live in a truck at a small french station. there are two other sappers and a lieutenant here. we deal chiefly with gifts and comforts sent to the troops…\\n\\nwe are out in the country. i think this railhead is about seven miles from the firing line. can hear the guns and see the star shells at night. i must ask you kindly to excuse me for writing in pencil because i have no pen and ink here. would you mind letting this letter be treated as to the whole of the statistical department, please sir. with kindest regards to all. i am yours obediently,\\n\\narthur smith my dear mother,\\n\\nhave just come through a particularly nasty period. we went into the trenches on wednesday night and on sunday morning at 5am our artillery commenced bombarding the german trenches and after 20 minutes had elapsed we went over the parapet. my goodness what a reception the huns had in store for us, they simply swept the ground with machine gun fire and shrapnel. poor old ‘c’ coy. caught it hot and neuve chapelle seemed to be a fleabite compared with this. it was found impossible to make any advance in our quarter, so i dug myself in and awaited events. it was horrible suspense, as i seemed to be the only man untouched, all around me, and being personally acquainted with each man made matters worse, in fact, it’s all wrong to call them men, as they were mostly mere boys.\\n\\n about early afternoon i was hailed from the trench as to whether it was possible for me to get back. i replied in the affirmative and decided to run the risk of getting potted on the way. so i commenced crawling on my stomach until about a few yards from the parapet, then made a spring and rushed headlong over the top, nearly spoiling the features of a few who happened to be in the trench and were not expecting me. we were relieved that afternoon, but some of the fellows did not get in until nightfall and these experienced another bombardment… billy hastings is quite fit and the only pal left. we have been resting since and getting information about the (illegible) but by all reports we shall be up again soon. no rest for the wicked it is said, and if true we must surely be a bad lot.\\n\\nwhat a terrible thing about the lusitania, and with so many americans aboard. should imagine there will be more trouble. have received box and letter dated 6th and am most thankful for everything you are all doing for me. (censored.)\\n\\nas regards the pads, (masks of cotton pads which served as gas masks), all we were served out with were made ‘on the spot’ and consisted of a piece of gauze and tape and were steeped in a solution of bicarbonate of soda, prior to this charge. i lost all my belongings except the gillette (razor) so should be glad of a few toilet requisites when next you are sending a parcel. do not trouble about towel and perhaps frank would get me a shaving brush. must now close. much love to all. from your affectionate son,\\n\\ndick i am much nearer the front now, and we moved here last tuesday. it was a long march and of course done at night, and our present billet is a farm (or the remains of one) in a large village about ¾ mile from the trenches, more north than we were before, and nearer the belgian frontier.\\n\\nit is an awfully desolate spot and constantly under shell fire. this morning i was trying to get a sleep on the grass, when a shell burst in a tree, not fifty yards away, and sent a shower of leaves to the ground. fortunately no one was hit, another burst in the same field ten minutes afterwards, then i thought it was time to shift! so went into a barn. there are a number of dugouts around, but they are so cold, and you might get buried inside. the farm is a vile place, with a lot of stagnant water around, and a lot of german soldiers are buried here. the barn where we sleep would be improved if a shell struck the roof, and ventilated it, in our absence! as the smell inside is bad, and makes it nearly necessary to wear a respirator! the rats seem to object to our company as they often have a free fight on top of us.\\n\\nlast night was my first experience in the trenches, and we returned to billet this morning. the din is simply awful, and just lately the big guns have been giving the enemy ‘beans’ every night. i am glad to say we had no casualties, although the rifle fire was heard at times, especially on our left, where the germans made an attack on the indian troops. the british gun fire was simply terrific, all night, and the germans did not reply very much. it was fine to watch the flashes of our guns at our backs, although the screaming of the shells overhead is at first rather ‘scaring’ to say the least of it!\\n\\nhowever the news we hear from day to day at this part of the front is very cheerful, and encouraging. yesterday i came across an indian soldier who could speak english very well, and he thought another month would see the war over, also a german officer captured near here, said it could not go on very much longer. i for one hope these remarks will prove correct!\\n\\nthe church here is practically demolished, just some of the walls and tower standing, and the churchyard is in a bad state. great holes have been made and bones exposed. in these holes is water sufficiently deep to drown anybody. great stone vaults have been opened, and coffins and bodies can be seen.\\n\\nof course the place here is not inhabited except by soldiers. i have been through some of the big houses, and plenty of good carved furniture, pictures, fittings etc. still remain in them. i also have been in some of the gardens, and roses just coming into bloom can be seen in great numbers. i should like to see them at home!\\n\\nwell i must close now, and hope you are all keeping well. again thanking you all for our good wishes. sincerely yours, s. frost dear nic,\\n\\nfirst of all i must thank you and… the others who sent me their kind letters of sympathy in regard to my brother sam. we all felt it very much at home and it was a great shock to our parents naturally, but it can’t be helped, as he was killed in a good cause.\\n\\ni suppose you have heard how we left bedford early on sunday 18/7/15 and had a lovely trip down the old firm to keyham, we were well laden and i was glad to get aboard and get to my berth in which i am very comfortable with two other warrant officers. the men and sergeants are on the troop deck and none too comfortable but are jogging along alright now.\\n\\nthe first part of the voyage the sea was very quiet, we passed gibraltar in a fog at night, so couldn’t see it. we then skirted the coast of algeria and had a pleasant run to malta where we stopped a full day. the higher officials went ashore for a few hours (including myself) and had a good time. i cannot mention troops or ships so refrain from doing so but there was a hell of a lot.\\n\\nour next stop was alexandria for three days, where we had another look round including a route march for the battalion. the sea is fairly rough at this end, rather surprising, but a lovely colour, light blue at day and dark at night. all lights out at 8.00, perfect darkness, there is no twilight to speak of, being dark at 7.30pm.\\n\\nwe then wondered where we were off to but eventually reached port said, stopped a day, went ashore, and off we go to the dardanelles which we expect to reach tonight.\\n\\nour kits have been left behind in egypt and all we have got we stand in. we are now passing through the aegean sea, full of rocky islands, very much like the highlands of scotland. bullen has just lost his helmet over the side, but is otherwise well…\\n\\ni am in the best of health at present and hope to go through alright. i expect you heard i got married a week before i left, a lot of us did the same thing, it was quite a common occurrence.\\n\\nour old boat is a captured german liner and is full up but we have got a greek crew with a few portuguese thrown in and so are a mixed lot, especially with welsh men aboard. how are things going at the office, i have been away nearly a year… i shall be glad to hear from you now and again just to keep in touch… i must close now as they say a mail is being collected before we land… yours sincerely,\\n\\ngeorge dear burgie,\\n\\nthanks awfully for your letter, glad to hear that you are all serene and that the g.w.r. is still flourishing without me, as a matter of fact i expect it’s better without me but still there you are.\\n\\nby jove! i had no idea that the audit had shoved so many fellows into khaki, its fine. well the old brigade has had some pretty varied experiences in this land of stinks and bad beer.\\n\\nwe landed at havre last march and after a freezing night under canvas on the heights behind the town we had a rather weird train journey up country. there were about 10 of us per cattle truck with a few wisps of straw to sleep on. our horses were boxed six in a truck, three with their heads facing the ‘engine’ and three facing the rear of the train. two men sat on corn sacks between their bottoms. if they kept the shutters closed they had a beautiful journey as it was so warm with the horses…\\n\\nat about 2am the old caboodle pulled up and we thought we were in for a dreary hang about, however the order came down to bring out the dixies… and fall in for something hot. i took our one up and the liquid smelt so good that with a little judicious wangling we managed to get another one full. when we tasted it, it was simply gorgeous. boiling hot coffee and rum as only frenchmen can make it, you know how. gee but it did go down a treat.\\n\\nwell after many jolts and bumps we arrived at our destination. it was miles from the firing line and a fearful hole at that. at nine next morning we were off again and went up further still, riding about 23 miles before we came to anchor at a rather dirty mining village…\\n\\nafter about three weeks in this show we shunted up and got our baptism. it’s a funny sensation being under fire for the first time but it soon wears off. one gets a rather nasty jolt when the first casualty occurs especially as it was in our case the finest fellow we had on the staff. he got a chunk of shell in the back of his neck and was killed on the spot.\\n\\nwe were in action at this place for about two months and took part in several bombardments, one of them being the one in which poor old joey was killed. we had some pretty rough times but were very fortunate as regards casualties. two month’s action and 2½ days’ rest, it doesn’t seem much but that’s what we got, and then at it again in a different part.\\n\\nthis show had been occupied by the germs and then by the french from whom we took over. the filth and stench was too awful for words, one of our batteries striking rather unlucky in coming across germs buried just under the surface when they started digging their guns in. the air was blue for miles…\\n\\nthe next action we had was a hell of a show. the staff were put into a huge chateau which was under observation and fire from three sides. and they didn’t half sling the lead about too. it’s marvellous that we didn’t get lifted skywards heaps of times, but still here we are. after a good spell in this show we came to rest again about 10 days or so ago.\\n\\nwe are having a good time here in the way of concerts, sports, boxing tournaments etc. the latter was great especially the bout between a farrier sergeant and a cook’s mate. they biffed at one another until neither could stand, it was awfully funny.\\n\\nlittle seedy ellis has got a snip job at a base. he came up today with a draught of men. he is having the time of his life and looks it by the dark circles under his eyes…\\n\\ni am feeling wonderfully fit and well and would not have missed coming out for quids. i suppose you saw in the paper that two of our boys have got the distinguished conduct medal. they were in major lord gorell’s battery; he is awfully bucked about it.\\n\\nwell old man i must dry up. i hope you can read this disgusting scrawl, but will make that whiskered excuse ‘active service conditions’. please remember me to all the boys and tell long liz that i would give anything for a barrel or two of the club bitter.\\n\\nsincerely,\\n\\ndick james dear mr rogers,\\n\\njust a few lines to let you know i am still alive and have up to now succeeded in dodging those small pieces of lead which have been so frequently flying about the peninsular [dardanelles]. i expect you are wondering how i got here, also why con. [convalescent] camp. i will try and tell you briefly what happened since our leaving egypt. we left alexandria 13th august and landed at the new landing at sulva bay on the 18th under shell fire. not a very nice kick off. our first engagement was on the 21st when we took part in the big fight for hill 70 and 971. i expect you read about it in the papers, for i see the daily sketch had a page full of it. they spoke of us as the irresistable yeomanry; very glowing words of our charge also. it was a very stiff go and we were fighting from 3pm the 21st until dark on the 22nd and never stopped advancing and retiring the whole time. we had the hill on the night of the 21st but could not hold it, because no support was sent up, so the yeomanry (those of us who were left) had to retire at night after charging and capturing three lines of turkish trenches. our brigade (berkshire, buckinghamshire and dorset yeomanry) was ordered to do the charging for the division and i think we did fairly well from what the general said in his report. of course we suffered pretty heavy. after five days on the peninsular we did not have an officer left in our regiment, and only barely half the men. i have seen a few of our officers in the casualty list, but no men. i was very pleased to get the grw magazine while resting in dugouts on chocolate hill. i hope no more of the audit boys have fallen since the last i saw. i suppose you are still pretty slack in the office. i find i’ve run away from the tale, but here in the y.m.c.a. tent it is so crowded and the piano on the go, it is rather difficult to write. after resting from the big fight three days we went into the trenches for spells of five days, on one case seven days. after five weeks i caught dysentery and had to come away. i was put on a hospital ship and brought to st. patrick’s hospital, malta. during those five weeks i was pretty lucky. the only close bullet was one through my right sleeve and grazing my arm. we all have some very narrow shaves from shrapnel. i had the sandbags of my dugout knocked down one day, but fortunately i was down to get water. probably, if i had been inside i would have caught it properly. i expect to be here about a fortnight to three weeks before i go back. i am hoping the boys will be across before that, and the turkish army cut in two.\\n\\ni suppose the office still looks more empty than it ever did. how is mr jackson getting on in france? i see his regiment has been in action. i have often wondered how he would get on in trench warfare. i suppose mcconnel is still going strong. will not stop for more now as i shall lose the mail. kind regards to mr cox and all the men on the section. hope you are still enjoying the best of health and still dodging the bombs. hope to write again soon. yours truly,\\n\\ne.j. cowles. dear effie,\\n\\nyou were doubtless surprised to get a postcard from up here, don’t know why they sent us such a long way north, it is alright but i think london would have suited me better, could have seen my pals sometimes. i am not allowed to get out of bed yet, tried the other night and fell down in a fit serves me right for disobeying orders. i have the piece of shell which fractured my skull and shall look after it for a souvenir. the doctors say i was very lucky not to have been put right out. it was a heavy piece (british) would not have been wounded by anything less. we were in an advanced post sticking beyond our front line called the “duck’s bill” and naturally pretty close to the german trenches. in fact they surrounded us… [lines censored]\\n\\ni hear from bedford that the company has been told to prepare for the dardanelles. i don’t know where he is though, have heard nothing from him. we are having a concert with our ward this afternoon and we have plenty of visitors in every afternoon, some very fair women taking them generally, and very decent too, treat everybody alike. remember me kindly to mrs lewis. i shall make a more determined attempt to see you if i get a sick leave which is most probable. well, have no more news at present. how about taking up a post in your department when this lot is over, it would suit me to have headquarters in london for a time, mustn’t count chickens though. goodbye old boy,\\n\\nregards,\\n\\nbilly dear mr hunt,\\n\\nthanks for the cigarettes and magazine, all very much appreciated and i want to confess something. i am terribly short of cigarettes just now. don’t know how to get on.\\n\\nso you had peter jackson up to see you a short time ago. lord, how i wish i could get up to london. some of our chaps have leave but this advance seems to have put a stop to it. that’s the only reason i am sorry for the long awaited advance. god knows it was really time we did do something if only to relieve the pressure on eastern front. we are in this part of the line and are still sitting tight worse luck. i wish they would get a move on here as well. it has cost us a good many casualties, but i think the germans, what with the bombardment they got and the counter attacks they delivered must have lost many more than us.\\n\\ni have got an interesting souvenir. it is part of the framework of a german aeroplane, the fourth which our airmen have recently brought down in this neighbourhood. the machine gun in one of our planes had killed the german pilot and the machine getting out of control exploded, or at least the engine did, and the whole aircraft crashed to earth. god, it was an awful mess. both the pilot and observer were killed, the former being bashed out recognition, but the latter survived the fall but died shortly afterwards. our airmen seem to be the masters of the germans now, although the taubes seem to be the faster machines, our men seem to have much spirit and initiative.\\n\\nabout a fortnight ago i saw a fleet of fourteen of our planes cross over our lines on a raiding expedition. they were in close formation, and the germans sent up a rain of shells without doing any damage. the raid was very successful, i believe, two transport trains full of german reinforcements being wrecked, a large station destroyed.\\n\\nwell that’s about all from me, let me hear from you soon. how is everybody up there? best regards to all the section,\\n\\nyours very sincerely, gilbert williams dear dada,\\n\\nmany thanks for the slough paper and magazines. was very sorry to see that jefferies and how have lost their lives. i heard from arthur this morning and he tells me that fred blane has died of wounds in the dardanelles. i expect you remember him in the “windsor operatic society”. [line censored]…\\n\\nharold white (ginger) who lived with arthur has joined the royal artillery garrison and is now at plymouth. arthur has sold the motorbike. petrol is too expensive he says. since i wrote last i have been moved to a little village about 2½ miles out of the town i was in then. it is a dead and alive hole with only a few houses and two cafes, only one of which is open. the other has had all the windows blown out.\\n\\nwe expect to move further on still in a day or two. we have changed our truck for a much larger one and have made ourselves very comfortable. it is about 30 feet long, so we have divided it off (with our ground sheets for curtains) at one end to make a bedroom, and the rest of the truck we have fitted up with desks and cupboards. i spent the other evening making a table out of bacon boxes etc. at present we are living very well indeed, with bacon and kidneys for breakfast, steaks and vegetables for dinner, jam and honey etc. for tea and bread and cheese and pickles for supper. not bad for “active service”. the post office cook still does all our cooking. there are four of us on the staff here now. one attached to each of the three divisions, and one learning the work who will probably leave soon to take charge of a division. there have been plenty of aeroplanes over here lately. a german came over the other evening and our people shelled it for about half an hour. i don’t know whether it was brought down or not. i had a nice long letter from mr hunt yesterday. he sent me photo of the “roll of honour” and told me all the latest audit office news. well, i don’t think i have much more to tell you at present so will conclude with love to all,\\n\\nyours, affectionately,\\n\\nmont. dear bert,\\n\\nmany thanks for your letter received a few days ago, also for the good old woodbines which i got today. while i think of it in your letter you refer to a report published in the 6th monthly magazine for august ’15, will you send me a copy, as i have not seen it.\\n\\nwell, we have had about the biggest gruelling we could wish for. the huns bombarded us in the trenches for over two hours with jack johnson* shells, shrapnel, whizz bangs* (terrible things) and trench mortars, blew the parapets to blazes and nearly blew the whole lot of us up. the general officer commanding has complimented us on our behaviour. we are now resting at a place called vlamertinghe, just south of ypres and a couple miles north of poperinghe [poperinge] in belgium. we deserve a rest for we have spent thirty-nine days in dugouts and the trenches (except three days) and needless to tell you we are very crummy, which tends to spoil the rest we are having. i never thought i was going to another phase of them after south africa. i was in poperinghe (where i met jackson a few weeks ago)…\\n\\nthe beauty of it out here is we can stand a pal a drink, and also have one with him. i suppose shall have to wait for my increase, being an absentee from the office, anyway they can add it on to my salary as soon as they like for i shall then be able to pay more income tax. i enclose a few postcards. they are showing in each card before and after, or during and after the bombardment of ypres, so you can guess what the place looks like. well bert in conclusion i must tell you that one of our sergeants who is on leave, posted this in london for me, that’s why i am able to give you a few details. kind regards to all friends in the audit,\\n\\nyour sincere friend,\\n\\njack symons. dear mr jones\\n\\njust a line to let you know that i’m still alive and am moving to king’s lynn on wednesday next. will write you later. how do you like the photo? best regards to the office. from,\\n\\nh. giles dear father,\\n\\ni do hope you and mother have not been worrying much about me as i am getting on all right. my wound is well now and the broken bone is my only trouble-  the two ends took the wrong turning first time so a couple of days ago they put them on the right road again. i ought not to be left with a short leg as there is about 40lb weight on the end of it, in fact i should not be surprised if it finishes off ahead of the other. one good thing is i get very little pain except when i am moved.\\n\\ndid you get my postcard? i haven’t had an answer yet but expect letters take a long while. i believe i asked you to send me some fruit but as things take such a long while to get here i am afraid it would be bad, besides they take french money here, and as i drew £5 from the field cashier only a few days before i was wounded i am quite well off and the orderly will buy fruit for me in the town.\\n\\ni expect you are surprised to get a letter when i said on the post card that i should only be allowed to write once from this hospital, but a fresh order has come out and one letter a month is allowed.\\n\\nwell, i have written quite enough about myself i think. i am longing to get a letter from you and mother, it seems ages since i heard from you. have you taken a house in uxbridge yet or are you waiting until auntie and uncle move there. i do hope you are getting a little more used to the lonely house. please remember me to everybody and give my love to all relations next time you write and tell them i should like to hear from them if they would write although i shan’t be able to answer their letters. have you heard how frank is getting on, i meant to write him but put it off too long.\\n\\ni expect my kit has been sent home, hasn’t it? i am afraid your field glasses are lost as i left my equipment in the wood when i was hit. i am awfully sorry if they are but perhaps one of the men picked them up. i arrived here with only one boot and only one puttee, so will you send me a pair of puttees and a tie out of my kit. i shall be supplied with boots when i leave here, which won’t be for a while i expect. one thing i shall be very glad to get will be some books.\\n\\nwe are very well treated here, and the belgian sisters from the convent are very good and often bring us grapes or apples.\\n\\ni didn’t get a very long run for my money, did i? it is rotten being out of the show, not that i wanted the war to last long, far from it, but while it was on i liked to have a finger in the pie, but it is no good grumbling and the best thing to do is to hope it will soon be over so that i can soon be home with you both again. please give my kind regards to kate. very best, love to you both. cheer up and don’t worry about me.\\n\\nyour loving son, (2nd lieutenant mayo)\\n\\ncharlie.\\n\\np.s. i hope you can read this, it is awkward writing lying down. several months ago, when we relieved the french of these trenches it was noticed how quiet the ‘atmosphere’ was, and it seemed quite in keeping with the beautiful hilly scenery. since the british occupation however, things here have livened up considerably, and it has been found necessary to greatly strengthen the trenches, and make dugouts much deeper and safer, because of the various kinds of souvenirs sent over from the enemy.\\n\\ntheir latest was the aerial mine, of which no doubt you have read. it is exactly like an oil drum to look at, with wood ends, and explodes with a terrific report. i don’t think it can be fired from a gun, as it comes tumbling across in such an awkward manner.\\n\\ni don’t think we manufacture these articles at woolwich as we can afford decent shells! we are not troubled very much by german artillery, but they make up for that with trench mortars and rifle grenades.\\n\\nas a signaller i escape some of the hardships of trench life, especially now the winter has arrived, and much prefer duties which keep one under shelter to those of exposure at the parapet! of course we have exciting times, when any wires are cut by trench mortars etc. and which need to be repaired at once wherever the break is.\\n\\njust lately i am having a lot of experience at making and fitting fireplaces in dugouts. we generally use biscuit tins to hold the fire and rummage among old houses in the village nearby for pieces of piping to take the smoke out, usually through the entrance as it is impossible to cut a hole through the roof on account of the sheet of iron. fuel for burning is generally a problem but a small supply of coke is allowed and we add to it all kinds of wood etc. when sitting up at night it is surprising what good time we keep when waking up the next fellow to carry on, if there is no fire, but if a good fire is on, we get quite generous, and don’t mind allowing the next man an extra hour or so to sleep!\\n\\nwe have had several days of rain this week, which doesn’t tend to improve life in the trenches, or out. on our journey to billets last saturday night, we took a road through a wood constructed by the royal engineers. it wasn’t quite finished, and in places was ankle deep in water, so our march was more of a paddle. parts of this wood, which is in a valley had been purposely flooded, so the road had to be laid on faggots and will be a piece of work when finished.\\n\\nwe are fortunate in having dry billets, with beds raised above the floor and a small fire. sheep skin coats have been issued to us, and are very warm. there is a fellow here now imitating a monkey and holding out a small cup to an audience seated on the beds, while another chap is playing an accordion! all we need now are top boots (tall rubber waders or gum boots designed to try and avoid the problem of trench foot) to paddle through the trenches! there is plenty of water about but very little to drink or wash in. it is a fine place for people who are good at finding excuses for not washing! but there are very good hot water baths here, only it isn’t any good having a bath unless one really needs it, on account of the colour of the water!!\\n\\nwe do very well though, for food and clothing both of which are good, and well supplied, and considering the many distant places it is sent from, it speaks well of the splendid way our navy is doing ‘its bit’… dear arthur,\\n\\ni really must make this effort to write to you and let you know how i am progressing. well so far as a little internal trouble i’m keeping fairly fit now that the cold weather has started, and on my present job i can doctor myself, i am prepared to stick this campaign until further orders.\\n\\nwe are now in our winter quarters and a very nice place it is. right on the edge of the cliffs, with a beautiful sea below, it reminds me very much of cornwall. then just across is the island of imbros, and the sunlight on those mountains is sometimes marvellous. on a quiet, warm day, with the birds singing, one wonders if there is a war on, but the blooming shells soon drive that idea away. it’s jolly cold now though, but we have been served out with nice thick underclothes, and waterproofs, and top boots and except for always living in the ground, our comforts have been looked after as far as possible. our food is as good as anyone could want, also i’m now used to a lot that before i’d turn my nose up at, and so long as the ships can land the goods i don’t think we shall be so badly off.\\n\\nmind it does blow, and the sea gets awfully rough and then no ships can come near us. we have the sea on three sides and the turks on the fourth, so we are truly between the devil and the deep sea. the turks still find some ammunition from somewhere whether our guns and the warships knock the very dickens out of them. it’s very exciting to watch a battle especially now it’s on our side the guns are not like at antwerp where we were the ones potted. now i am too sleepy to continue and as the firing has quieted down i’m going to sleep and continue tomorrow.\\n\\n5/12/15. i’ve not had a chance to finish this letter before, so here goes. we’ve had snow and rain and thunder and such lightening, and lord it has been cold, everything frozen and even the water in my water bottle. but today has been beautifully mild and calm, almost like summer again. i have just received a packet of letters from my wife, written at different times since may, so am still in hopes that there may be some more back dates knocking around the world for me. we had three men killed last night in a little spasm, and today our guns and the turks have been flinging dirt at each other. we used to duck once upon a time, as the shells came over, but now everyone seems curious to see what sort of a burst it will be and how much dust is knocked up, and heaps have cameras taking photos.\\n\\nenclosed is a bit of heather which grows in great profusion all over the peninsular. and the troops use in the trenches to boil their dixies on. and now about the office. do you know but, it’s quite an effort to remember the routine now…\\n\\ni suppose mr millow is still with you and is there any chance of h.r.h. goff joining say as a s.c. (probably senior clerk)? there is now a singing in the air and bang just as i write they’ve dropped one over to us. sometimes a shell bursts, and when we are working at something we don’t even know it’s come along. it’s funny what you can get used. but to get back to the office. i expect you have heaps of ladies there now, lord i haven’t seen a woman since april. what do they look like? i expect they scent out the office, and how careful you all must be not to swear. we often laugh here at the thought that if ever we do return to civil life again, we’ll be digging a little hole in the garden to live in and stirring up our tea with a bit of stick or our finger and just spit on the floor when smoking and if a little tickling in our shirt, just hopping it off in the street.\\n\\ni am out of paper (he is writing this on envelope), but it don’t matter. how are the lambs going? here’s one that’s doing a little doing a little bleat far from home. i’d like to come you know, and have a rub at a bed and a roof, also a drop of beer perchance. living in a hole for seven months now and the blue sky above gets a bit monotonous at times especially when the dirt will persist in falling on your face when you are trying to sleep and when it rains you’re up to your knees in no time, and that’s always at night. we had rum served out tonight and do you know, i can’t bear the stuff, just pause and think by the wayside, i can’t drink rum, in fact i hate it. how we do change by time. now how is everyone down the club? remember me to emmie and mrs fellows and may. i understand that mr welsh and mr davies have been awfully kind to my wife, and i reckon its jolly good of them. this war seems to have found me so many kind friends, i don’t know what i’ll do to repay them all if i live through this…\\n\\nwhat has become of beaumont and jackson, and is my pal jimmy edwards still alive,… bert i’d like to send you a turkish shell but the post office won’t accept them for transit, anyhow perhaps i’ll bring home a nose fuse for a paper weight. do you know back in the summer i had a shell drop just off the seat of my trousers and it did not explode. kaw! it was a bit of luck, i didn’t stop to pick him up though, in case he changed his mind later. well now i’ve tried to remember everyone, but do you give heartiest good wishes to the office for a merry xmas and a victorious new year and trusting you’ll all be safe from zeppelins. yours very sincerely,\\n\\nt. harold watts the last time i wrote i think i told you we had lost our comfortable job on\\nrailheads. we have been shifted from general headquarters and are at\\nthe most godforsaken hole there can possibly be in france. we had a\\nrotten journey raining all the time. reveille* was at 4am and we\\neventually left the station about 10am. the accommodation consisted of\\nthe old cattle trucks, and rations of bully and biscuits. it was a very cold\\nand uncomfortable journey.\\nwe arrived at our destination about 4.30pm and after standing in the rain\\nfor 2½ hours with full pack on, we set out on a ten mile march. it’s the\\nworst march i’ve ever done. the majority of us at the finish were\\nabsolutely knocked up and were only too glad to crawl into the billets\\nbefore going to bed, which was about 12pm. they gave us a mug of tea\\n(the first we had since six in the morning) and best of all a ration of rum.\\nthe up to date soldier kit to carry about from place to place consists of\\n150 rounds of ammunition, inside the pack; overcoat, fur coat, two pairs\\nsocks, one pants, one shirt, ground sheet, iron rations [emergency food\\nsupply]. outside pack; mackintosh and mess tin, in haversack; cleaning\\nkit, hold all, 24lbs rations, soap and towel, and on top of that extras such\\nas handkerchiefs, plate, mug, tobacco, etc, two smoke helmets* in a\\nsatchel slung over the shoulder, a respirator in the left flap of a tunic and\\nfield dressing on the right, and of course the rifle, in all it’s no light weight\\non a long march, it takes all one’s strength and staying power to keep\\ngoing.\\nwe are billeted in a barn and have a sea of mud to get through. we have\\nno boards, so sleep on the ground, fires are not allowed in the billet and\\nat night time it’s devilish cold.\\nin the village there is a little general shop (now nearly sold out), one pub\\nwhere they sell something they charge 2½d for and call beer, there are\\nno shops of any description and of course no amusements.\\nrations are not so good now (today’s dinner, sunday, bully beef, stew\\nand two potatoes between 35 men. we have a loaf and a bit (small loaf)\\nand two tins of jam between seven men, the short bread issue being\\naugmented by the world famous army biscuits.\\nour captain is a perfect gentleman and about the most popular man in\\nthe regiment, the junior captain (an absolute sport) and the platoon\\nofficers are all very decent sort of fellows. we appear to be much better\\noff in this respect than before, and certainly think that d. co. has got as\\ngood a selection of officers as any other company in the battalion. one of\\nour fellows ran across a number of audit r.e.s and they enquired after\\nmaggs and myself.\\nfreddy or\\nwhat’s left of him after some very stiff marching. dear mr hunt,\\ni expect you have heard at the office about me being in england suffering\\nfrom gas poisoning, and as it is quite a long time since i last wrote to\\nyou, no doubt a few lines will be acceptable, to explain matters.\\nwe left the trenches at vimy ridge on july 5th, and marching back about\\n14 miles we eventually reached a village named ostreville for the purpose\\nof having a divisional rest. the signallers thought an orchard would be\\nvery convenient to erect bivouacs in, so when we were busy carrying out\\nthis idea an old frenchman appeared at the scene, and raised objections.\\nhowever he agreed at last to allow us in at one end of the orchard,\\nthinking, i suppose, that we would wander about his place! we had an\\nenjoyable time here for six days, and then had to return to our old billets\\nnear mount st. eloi until the whole of the division had retired. we guessed\\nby this move that our ‘rest’ was over, and the following days were spent\\nin marching, and travelling by motor lorries and train until we arrived at\\nmericourt station on july 21st near albert.\\nafter a delightful swim in the river near the billet we marched off the\\nfollowing night, to take part in the ‘big push.’ we slept in an open field\\nthat night near fricourt farm, and were rather rudely awakened by a few\\ngerman shells landing near us.\\nfor five days we were lying in reserve in this district, and occupied our\\ntime in watching an army of men at work in the valley, making roads,\\nrailways, boring for water and laying down water pipes, also practicing\\nattacks in the old trenches. it was very interesting to see the great\\namount of artillery, busy practically all day and night, and to read their\\nmessages sent by visual signalling [often using lights] from a ridge across\\nthe valley.\\nour period in reserve being up, we moved to mametz wood to lie there in\\nsupport for five days, before going into the trenches at high wood. on\\narrival at the edge of the wood at night, we were welcomed by a big dose\\nof gas shells and shrapnel, which was applied steadily throughout the\\nnight by the german artillery. having to assist in putting our signalling\\ngear into a hole for safety, i was prevented from using my respirator for\\nthe first quarter of an hour, as we could not see on account of the\\ndarkness and dust made by the ammunition columns rushing along the\\nroad, and it was during this time that i must have breathed in enough gas\\nto put me out of action. afterwards of course respirators were used, when\\nwe were settled in holes by the roadside for the night.\\ni remained with the battalion until i was sent to the casualty clearing\\nstation on august 3rd and reached rouen hospital the next day. i had to\\nwait until the 9th and crossed the channel from havre to southampton on\\nthe new zealand ship marama, with about 800 other patients, the day\\nafter. it was a splendid boat with every convenience for carrying wounded\\nmen, and the sisters and orderlies were colonials.\\nit was last friday week when i arrived here, and must say it is very\\ncomfortable and quiet. i had to remain in bed until last saturday, but of\\ncourse i cannot do any route marching yet! so i have to take life quietly,\\nwhich is no hardship i can assure you after france. i am on an ordinary\\ndiet, and taking medicine.\\ni hear you have mr symons back again, is that so? and is he back in the\\nsame old spot? i hope he is pretty fit, although i suppose there must be\\nsomething wrong with him, to be back again.\\ni suppose things are as quiet as usual with you. have you had your\\nholidays yet? this is about your time i believe. i shall be glad of a few\\nlines when you have time, to hear the latest about the office. i hope you\\nare keeping fit, also mr j.b. taylor and mr woodhams and with kind\\nregards to you all. yours sincerely,\\nfrosty.\\np.s. it is a treat to write a letter without the censor’s shadow over one! dear mr hunt,\\nthanks very much for your letter which i received a week or two ago, also\\nfor the magazine.\\nwe are in the trenches just now. in fact we seem to spend about three\\ntimes as much time in as we do out. also we are in a pretty warm spot, it\\nwas about here, towards the end of last summer that the french and\\ngerman had some of the fiercest fighting of the war. the country around\\nabout is a veritable maze of trenches. the fighting at one time was so\\nfierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the\\ntrenches, and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly\\nseeing the bones of men’s legs or their boots, or skulls sticking out from\\nthe sides of the trenches, pleasant, eh? there will be a pleasant smell\\nhere in the summer. i only hope we are not here then. in places we are\\nonly about twenty yards away from fritz and company. consequently all\\ntimes the air is pretty thick with bombs, grenades and trench mortars.\\nthese last are pretty hellish sort of toys. they have an explosion like\\nabout ten earthquakes rolled into one. but even these are not the worst\\nwe have to put up with. the trenches being so close together there is of\\ncourse any amount of mining going on. so one never knows when the\\nparticular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through\\nthe solar regions. when a mine does go up, there is some excitement\\nknocking about i can tell you. suppose for instance we were going to\\nexplode one, all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot\\nand directly the mine is exploded, there is hell let loose on the crater. of\\ncourse as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies, so that the air is\\nfairly full of everything that kills quickly. one can on these occasions\\nalways rely on a good many casualties. since we have been in this spasm\\nthere have been five exploded in this neighbourhood, while others are\\nexpected to go up at any time. so much for conditions here.\\nhow is everything in town? pretty quiet i suppose. i see you’ve had the\\nzepps (zeppelins) over again? is it a fact that one dropped in the\\nthames? (lines censored.) that is about all the news, so will close,\\nkindest regards to everybody. yours very sincerely,\\ngilbert williams. dear mr smith,\\ni hope you will accept my apology for not writing before. it has not been\\nwant of will it has been lack of opportunity. i wonder how you all are. i\\nam fairly well now but was very queer for several weeks recently. i also\\noften wonder how you are all getting on and should like to hear.\\na matter of about five minutes ago fritz was bombing us, and i have just\\ngot up off the ground where i was laying for about twenty minutes. one\\nfellow has been hit, but not severely by shrapnel. this is his second visit\\nthis evening.\\nit will soon be twelve months since i left you. it seems a very long time\\nago. i am afraid i have very little i may tell you, so will conclude by\\nasking you to accept my best wishes for the new year and desiring that\\nyou will remember me kindly to any enquiring friends. believe me, dear\\nmr smith, sincerely yours,\\nw. wiggs sunday\\ndear charlie,\\nhow are things going with you now? i expect like the rest of us will be\\nglad when the better weather sets in for there is no doubt about it, it has\\nbeen rough lately.\\nsince i last wrote to you we have shifted to another part of the line and it\\nis a warm shop, for both sides must have all guns they can find and it is\\nnothing but one long duel all day and every day but thank goodness it\\ngives over a bit a night so that one can get on with their work. you see of\\na night the flashes of the guns can be seen so plainly that is why they do\\nnot fire a lot then.\\njust on our right our people retook some trenches we had lost, oh what a\\nrough time the poor devils had, snow and mud as much as you like and\\nthey had to lay in it for two days and grub could not be got to them. i\\nexpect there have been a few more from paddington called up by now, it\\nseems if the authorities mean to have all the men they want and if they\\ncan’t get them one way they will another, and it certainly looks as if they\\nwill be wanted for out here. one cannot see any signs of an early\\nsettlement. i see by the papers that the air raids have been busy in\\nengland again. i suppose you have not seen anything of them yet, has\\nrory moore had any more frights? we have the taubes [german aircraft]\\nover our hospital nearly every day or night and i can tell you we got some\\nstarts at times. the nearest we have to them since i have been here is\\njust one yard from the main door, at 12.30 it blew in two pairs of double\\ndoors and shattered on end of the building to bits but not a great deal of\\ndamage to life which after all is the main thing. the arrangements we in\\nwork is five or six days up the line and four or five down if you are lucky.\\nof course at times these arrangements go to pot when there is an attack\\nand we get a warm time and i should like to enlarge on these things but\\nof course you understand i cannot.\\ngive my kind regards to all and trusting you are well.\\nyours will dear mr w.h. davies,\\n\\njust a line to let you know i have not forgotten you. i received a letter on\\ntuesday 3rd of january 1917 which you sent to me on august 24th 1916.\\nby the marking on the envelope it has been round to various regiments\\nand officers, but it has arrived quite safe at last. i received the letter you\\nwrote in october quite safe. i am sorry i have not written before but we\\nwere rather busy when i received your last letter and we could not send\\nmore than a field card for about a month. well i am pleased to tell you\\nthat i am still going on first rate. i expect you will be surprised to hear\\nthat i have left the northamptonshire regiment and am now attached to\\nthe army printing and stationary services. we are opening a new branch\\nin the photography line and i am here as a photographer.\\ni am unable to tell you more than this up to the present. i expect harry\\nwill be pleased to hear this as he used to give me quite a lot of tuition in\\nthis respect.\\nthere are only two of us here up to the present and as the dark rooms\\nare not finished yet we are having an easy time. the officer is away in\\nengland just now getting some more photographic apparatus so we are\\non our own and i am in charge.\\nwe are billeted with a company of australian electricians, mechanics,\\nmining and boring engineers and are having a fine time. there are a good\\nlot of fellows and make us very welcome. we had a grand xmas with\\nthem and they know how to enjoy themselves. you can understand what\\na change this is after being in the line. just before i came on this job we\\nhad over a month in and out of the line waiting to go over the top when\\nthe weather was favourable.\\nwe went in for four days then out for a rest for about three days then\\nback again. the water was over our knees in the trenches and it was\\nimpossible to use the communication trenches at all. we were holding the\\nfront line with two platoons (i should say our boys’ section of the line).\\nour platoon was twenty two strong including the officer, and during the\\nbombardment we had eight put out in ten minutes. there were no\\ndugouts of any description there, so you can imagine what it was like to\\nstand there for four nights. we hoped the weather would be alright so\\nthat we could go over and get it done with but it was not to be. we were\\nout digging one night when they let us have it for five hours with gas\\nshells, we had two chaps hit with them and put right out.\\nthe sights and smells were awful, as a good many of the chaps lay just as\\nthey fell during the advance. it was impossible to bury them. also there\\nwere about a dozen dead horses round about in the mud that were killed\\nby shell fire while bringing up ammunition for the guns. our guns never\\ncease down there, as soon as one section stop, another lot open out so\\nyou can tell there is somme noise.\\nthe last time we came out, was for forty eight hours’ rest then in again\\nand over, but the troops were in such a bad condition that the doctor sent\\nin a report saying we were not fit for the line so two other regiments in\\nour division went over in our place.\\nwe were held in reserve and i am glad to say not required after all. well i\\nthink this is about all, for now, i have been with the a.p. & s.s. since\\ndecember 1st and i can tell you, i hope i shall stop here. i have no desire\\nto go back to the line. kindly remember me to all old friends. with kind\\nregards to yourself and all on section 4.\\nyours sincerely, h.a. skilling\\nno. 2 section advanced section\\narmy printing & stationary service… dear mr taylor,\\nno doubt you think that i have forgotten all about you and my friends of\\nthe audit, but never let it be said (this is an army term, if you please.)\\ntruth to tell i have been going to write time after time, but have had to\\nput it off for various reasons. i am taking this opportunity of writing to\\nyou, while i am in charge of tonight’s guard. i get this job about once a\\nweek now, it’s not so bad, i have three men and a man in waiting; we\\nmount at 5pm and dismiss at 7am. we make ourselves as comfortable as\\nwe can, in the guard tent, which just covers over the top of the sand\\nbags, and these have got grass growing out of them now. the sand bags \\nare about 4ft high and make a good protection. april 1st i got my two\\nstripes up, after being a 1st air mechanic for 12 months, the noncommissioned officers have a very decent mess here, and everything is\\nok. i am corporal in charge of wireless, photographic, electrical and all\\ninstruments used on aeroplanes, i have had a very good education on all\\nthose subjects, but the one i like best is the wireless, it’s far more\\ninteresting than photography, which is a very big thing indeed out here,\\nand a lot depends upon a good photograph of the hun lines…\\nyesterday i saw a nice little game between one of ours and one of theirs,\\nafter our anti-aircraft fire had taken it up a bit higher, our machine went\\nfor it and got well over the top of it, then two more of ours came along\\nand forced it down, she tried all manner of tricks, but down she came\\nalright, and landed a clean machine, not broken in any part, and the two\\nhuns inside it quite well.\\nwe gave a revue (theatrical show) to our chaps here on the 13th, it went\\noff alright, we started at 9pm and gave a two hours show, am enclosing\\nprogramme, and will forward a photo of myself as the ‘oldest inhabitant’\\nas soon as i receive them from the frenchman who took them…kind\\nregards to all of the section and the remainder of the agreements, and\\nhoping you are fit and well. good bye. yours sincerely,\\nf.r. morris dear charles,\\njust a line to let you know i am getting on fine. i have been in france\\nsince good friday morning. well it is not so bad, but of course not so\\ncomfortable as the office work.\\nwe had the lord mayor of london over to see us the other sunday when\\nwe were resting, he made a little speech.\\nhow are all at the office? you might remember me to mr woodhams, mr\\njones and mr cowan and the boys also the girls. i suppose mr redford\\nhas retired by now.\\nwe have been in the trenches since the 13th and i expect we shall go out\\nshortly. our little dugout has just been flooded out, a very heavy\\nthunderstorm, but we have run it out. it is rotten to see how the towns\\nhave been shelled to pieces. i don’t suppose they will ever be rebuilt.\\nmy brother was home on leave some time ago that is the second time so\\nhe has not got off badly. he has been promoted to sergeant now. he\\nseems to be getting on fine.\\nhave you seen ernie smith? how is he getting on, is he still in the a.p.c.\\n(army pay corps, non-fighting troops)? as i hear a lot have been\\ntransferred into line regiments.\\nwell here’s to the time when the war is all over and we are back in the\\nsame old place. the trenches where we were are only 25 to 30 yards from\\nthe huns so had to keep a bit low.\\nmy address is 3343 lance corporal j. davies, no. 1 platoon d company,\\n6th city of london rifles, b.e.f., france. you might drop me a line to let\\nme know how you are getting on and any news,\\nkind
